// Mutual-exclusion lock for the regression-test-playbook.md smoke-test
// sandbox (apra-fleet-egc.1).
//
// Bug: the sandbox lives at a fixed, well-known path ($HOME/temp/.apra-
// fleet-tests) by design -- see the playbook's rationale (no per-run random
// directory, so no hand-off file is needed between ## Setup / ## Test
// scenario / ## Teardown). But a fixed path has no mutual exclusion of its
// own: if two regression passes are ever in flight against the same machine
// at once, the second run's ## Teardown ('node dist/index.js stop' + 'rm -rf
// $SANDBOX') can destroy the first run's sandbox while it is still mid-
// Setup or mid-Test-scenario.
//
// Fix: a lock file living NEXT TO the sandbox (sibling path, '<sandbox>.lock'
// -- deliberately outside the directory '## Teardown' rm -rf's, so the lock
// itself is never a casualty of the very cleanup it is meant to gate) records
// the PID of whoever currently owns the sandbox. ## Setup acquires it (or
// fails loud, 'sandbox busy', non-zero exit) before touching anything;
// ## Teardown only removes the sandbox (and the lock) if it can prove it
// owns it.
//
// Two-phase ownership, to cover the WHOLE Setup-through-Teardown window with
// no gap, given each '## Setup' / '## Test scenario' / '## Teardown' section
// of the playbook runs as its OWN separate shell/process invocation (so a
// PID recorded by one code block is not, by itself, a reliable liveness
// signal for a LATER code block of the same logical run):
//   1. acquire(): '## Setup' claims the lock FIRST, before any mutation
//      (mkdir/install/clone), recording the Setup shell's PID. apra-fleet-
//      5co8.39: this used to be the shell's own self-reported $$, but under
//      Git Bash on Windows that is a bash-internal (MSYS) pid which
//      defaultDeps.isAlive's process.kill(n, 0) below CANNOT see (native
//      Windows pid namespace) -- so a live Setup shell could be reported
//      stale and reclaimed out from under it. Fixed by having the CLI (see
//      main(), 'acquire' branch) record process.ppid instead: since 'node
//      scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs acquire ...' is itself spawned AS A CHILD of
//      the Setup shell, process.ppid resolves that parent in the SAME
//      native-OS pid namespace process.kill() checks, on every platform
//      (including win32 under Git Bash) -- no MSYS-aware isAlive branch
//      needed. That PID stays alive for the rest of that same '## Setup'
//      code block (one continuous shell process), which covers the early
//      window before the sandbox's own fleet server exists yet.
//   2. markServerStarted(): once '## Setup' has run 'node dist/index.js
//      start', it re-points the lock at the sandbox's own long-lived fleet
//      server PID (read from the sandbox's own server.json) -- that process
//      stays alive for the ENTIRE remainder of the run (through
//      '## Test scenario', how ever long that takes), right up until
//      '## Teardown' stops it. This covers the rest of the window with no
//      gap: the hand-off from the Setup shell's PID to the server's PID
//      happens while the Setup shell's PID is still alive (it is the very
//      process performing the hand-off).
//   3. authorizeAndReleaseLock(): '## Teardown' reads the sandbox's OWN
//      current server PID (same server.json) and compares it to the lock's
//      recorded PID. Only a live PID that does NOT match is refused (that is
//      the actual hazard this bug is about: someone else's live run still
//      owns this sandbox). A missing lock, or a lock recording a PID that is
//      no longer alive (an abandoned/crashed prior run), is treated as safe
//      to reclaim -- otherwise a single crash would permanently strand the
//      sandbox with no way to clean it up.
//
// CLI (used directly by regression-test-playbook.md -- see '## Setup' /
// '## Teardown'):
//   node scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs acquire <sandbox-path>
//   node scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs mark-server-started <sandbox-path>
//   node scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs release <sandbox-path>
// 'acquire' takes no explicit pid argument -- it records this CLI process's
// own process.ppid (see main(), apra-fleet-5co8.39), which is the Setup
// shell's real, native OS pid regardless of shell family.
//
// Every exported function below takes an optional 'deps' object (fs
// primitives + an 'isAlive' predicate) purely for test injection -- mirrors
// scripts/check-sandbox-sync-remote.mjs's pattern -- so apra-fleet-egc.2 can
// exercise the busy/stale/owns/refuse decision logic without real processes
// or a real filesystem.
