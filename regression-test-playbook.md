# Fleet Regression Test Playbook

Run by `regression-test-runner` to prove EXISTING functionality still works.
It is NOT a gate on the current sprint's new work: feature-closure testing
for the current cycle's features lives in `integ-test-playbook.md` instead.
(The `deployer` agent is a different role: it follows `deploy.md` to install
the software on a target. It does not run this file. When it deploys ahead
of a regression pass it uses `deploy.md`'s `## Sandbox Deploy (for
integration/regression testing)` section, NOT its production `## Deploy`
section -- see "Two different things both called 'sandbox'" below.)

**Two different things both called "sandbox" -- do not conflate them:**

- **This playbook's smoke-test sandbox** (`## Setup` / `## Reset` /
  `## Teardown` below): a throwaway `HOME` at
  `~/temp/.apra-fleet-tests` containing a fresh `install`, a cloned toy
  repo, and its own beads DB, used to run ONE toy sprint end to end. Its
  purpose is to exercise install + registration + sprint as a scenario.
- **`deploy.md`'s Sandbox Deploy**: an isolated running fleet MCP server +
  supervisor pair (separate `APRA_FLEET_DATA_DIR` / `APRA_FLEET_PORT` /
  `FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR`, no installer, no OS auto-start registration) that
  `deployer` stands up so a test deploy never restarts the machine's shared
  production singleton, keyed on the sprintId, and normally torn down by
  `integ-test-runner` at the end of its cycle.

They use the same isolation primitives and the same reasoning, but they are
provisioned by different roles at different times and neither replaces the
other. This playbook's `## Setup` provisions its own sandbox HOME itself and
does not depend on a `deployer` having run first.

**Leftover sandbox-deploy sweep.** If Deploy succeeded but Integ Test never
ran in the last cycle, that sprint's sandbox deploy is still up. Before
returning, run `node scripts/sandbox-deploy.mjs teardown --sprint-id "<the
sprintId in your dispatch prompt>"` -- exit 0 with "nothing to tear down" is
the normal case; it only kills processes it can prove are that sandbox's own
(see `deploy.md` Teardown).

Run BOTH parts for a full regression pass:

- **Part 1 -- real functional tests.** Section `## Run the apra-fleet-se
  suite against real bd`. The full `apra-fleet-se` test suite, unmocked,
  against the real `bd` CLI, at branch HEAD.
- **Part 2 -- smoke test.** Sections `## Setup`, `## Test scenario`,
  `## Reset`, `## Teardown`. One toy sprint end to end in a throwaway
  sandbox it provisions fresh for itself: install, server boot, member
  registration, sprint, harvest.

The smoke test's sandbox never touches the real `~/.apra-fleet`
(production) install or its credentials/registry. It lives at a fixed,
well-known path (not a random per-run directory) so no hand-off file is
needed between steps.

Because the path is fixed, two regression passes in flight against the same
machine at once would otherwise stomp on each other -- specifically, a
second run's `## Teardown` (`node dist/index.js stop` + `rm -rf $SANDBOX`)
can destroy a first run's sandbox while it is still mid-`## Setup` or
mid-`## Test scenario`. `## Setup` and `## Teardown` below guard against
this with a lock file living NEXT TO the sandbox (`$SANDBOX.lock` --
deliberately outside the directory `## Teardown` deletes, so the lock is
never a casualty of the cleanup it gates), via `scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs`:
- `## Setup` acquires the lock before touching anything (mkdir/install/
  clone); if another live run already holds it, Setup fails loud with a
  `sandbox busy` message and a non-zero exit instead of proceeding.
- `## Teardown` only `rm -rf`s the sandbox (and releases the lock) if it can
  prove it owns it -- a live lock naming a PID other than this sandbox's own
  fleet server is left untouched.
- A single normal `## Setup` -> `## Test scenario` -> `## Teardown` pass is
  unaffected: the lock is acquired at the start and released at the end, as
  before.

**If `## Setup`'s busy-check refuses (non-zero exit), STOP the whole pass
right there.** Do not proceed to `## Test scenario`, and do not run
`## Teardown` either: this run never acquired the lock, so it has nothing of
its own to tear down, and `## Teardown`'s ownership check -- which compares
the lock's recorded PID against the sandbox's own currently-running server --
cannot by itself distinguish "a stray/misfired Teardown call for a run that
never actually owned this sandbox" from "this run's own legitimate Teardown"
once another live run's Setup has since completed the hand-off to its own
server PID. The busy-check at the start of `## Setup` is what actually
prevents that ambiguity from ever arising -- respect its exit code.

Conventions used below:
- Sandbox root: `~/temp/.apra-fleet-tests` (`$HOME/temp/.apra-fleet-tests`
  on POSIX, `%USERPROFILE%\temp\.apra-fleet-tests` on Windows).
- Scratch port: `18700` (`APRA_FLEET_PORT`) -- the fleet MCP server (`node
  dist/index.js start`). Kept away from the default MCP server port `7523`,
  viewer ports starting at `8081` (DEFAULT_SPAWNER_BASE_PORT in
  packages/apra-fleet-se/src/supervisor/spawner.mjs), and the dolt settle
  port range `13300-13400` (DEFAULT_PORT_RANGE in
  packages/apra-fleet-se/fleet-sprint/dolt-settle.mjs).
- Supervisor scratch port: `18701` (`SUPERVISOR_PORT` below) -- the
  fleet-sprint supervisor (`packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/serve.mjs`),
  distinct from the fleet MCP server's `18700` above and from every range
  in the previous bullet.
- `<repo-root>`: the root of this apra-fleet checkout -- the directory
  containing this playbook. The executing agent substitutes its actual
  checkout path.

Target time for the smoke test: under 10 minutes (Setup + one
`max_cycles:1` toy sprint + Teardown). Any single step over 2 minutes is a
bug in its own right, not just a slow test.

## Permissions

Commands below require coverage for these prefixes by SOME entry in
`permissions.allow` of EITHER `.claude/settings.json` OR
`.claude/settings.local.json` (where the fleet's compose_permissions tool
delivers). A broader prefix entry counts as coverage -- e.g. `Bash(node:*)`
covers `node dist/index.js`, `Bash(git:*)` covers `git clone`, and
`Bash(bd:*)` covers `bd`. Only report a permissions block if a prefix has
no covering entry in either file, or a command is actually denied at
runtime:
- `Bash(mkdir *)`
- `Bash(rm -rf ~/temp/.apra-fleet-tests*)`
- `Bash(node dist/index.js *)`
- `Bash(node:*)` -- covers the sandbox lock's
  `node "<repo-root>/scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs" acquire|mark-server-started|
  release` calls in `## Setup` and `## Teardown`, and every other
  `node "<repo-root>/scripts/*.mjs"` helper this playbook invokes
  (`kill-port.mjs`, `reap-sandbox-dolt.mjs`, `sandbox-seed-beads.mjs`,
  `check-sandbox-sync-remote.mjs`, `check-toy-doer-credentials.mjs`). A
  relative-prefix entry like `Bash(node scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs *)` does
  NOT cover any of these: the invocations use the absolute `<repo-root>/...`
  form (see Conventions above), so only a broader `Bash(node:*)`-class
  entry satisfies it. Note: `kill-port.mjs`/`reap-sandbox-dolt.mjs` in turn
  spawn their own subprocesses internally (`netstat`/`taskkill` on Windows,
  `lsof`/`ps` on POSIX) -- those do NOT need their own permission entries,
  the same way `sandbox-lock.mjs`'s and `check-sandbox-sync-remote.mjs`'s
  own internal `git`/`bd` calls never have: the permission layer gates this
  playbook's own `Bash` tool calls, not what a permitted process spawns
  internally.
- `Bash(git clone *)`
- `Bash(git -C ~/temp/.apra-fleet-tests* *)`
- `Bash(node scripts/run-integ-suites.mjs *)` (for the
  "Run the apra-fleet-se suite against real bd" section only)
- `Bash(npm run test:slow*)` (same section, the slow-lane run)
- `Bash(tail:*)` (same section -- reading the persisted slow-lane verdict
  after an interrupted shell)
- `Bash(bd *)` (for "Reporting failures" below -- `bd search` to dedupe and
  `bd create` to file the parent-less carry-over beads; also the sandbox
  `bd show`/`bd dolt` steps in `## Setup` and `## Test scenario`)
- `Bash(curl:*)` -- drives the supervisor's HTTP API (`POST /api/sprints`,
  `GET /api/sprints/:id`, `GET /api/members`, `POST /api/shutdown`) in
  `## Setup`, `## Test scenario`, and `## Teardown`.
- `Bash(node scripts/sandbox-deploy.mjs *)` -- the leftover sandbox-deploy
  sweep above; `Bash(node:*)` covers it.
- `Bash(kill:*)` -- covers the supervisor-boot verification and stop steps'
  own direct `kill -0`/`kill -9` calls (the port and dolt-sql-server kill
  loops now run through the `kill-port.mjs`/`reap-sandbox-dolt.mjs` helpers
  above, already covered by `Bash(node:*)`).

## Run the apra-fleet-se suite against real bd

Part 1 of the pass. Runs the full `packages/apra-fleet-se` test suite
against the real `bd` CLI (not the recorded mock), against branch HEAD, and
files failures per "Reporting failures" below. It is Bash-only and
independent of the smoke-test sandbox below. Follow the step-by-step
procedure in `packages/apra-fleet-se/test/INTEG-SUITE.md`, which drives
`scripts/run-integ-suites.mjs` (start a background run, poll with bounded
waits, report the final summary). Never substitute a bare `npm test` here
-- that would test the mock.

Note (bd record/replay shim): plain `npm test` for this workspace now runs
in bd REPLAY mode by default (bd CLI responses served from recorded
fixtures under `packages/apra-fleet-se/test/fixtures/bd-recordings/`; see
the README there), so it completes in seconds. The unmocked, real-bd run
-- the pre-shim behavior, and the right lane for validating bd CLI
compatibility or re-measuring real-bd wall time -- is:

```bash
npm run test:integration --workspace=@apralabs/apra-fleet-se
```

Also run the slow lane (`test/slow/`): two real-time watchdog regression
tests (~8 minutes total) excluded from the default `test` script and from
CI, but still owned by this once-per-sprint pass -- they prove Node's
event-loop keep-alive and full retry-exhaustion timing for the dispatch
watchdog, which cannot be faked with mock timers (see the file-level
comments in each for why).

Redirect combined stdout+stderr to a log file instead of
piping through `tail` -- a bare pipe leaves nothing persisted if the
background shell running this command is interrupted, so an ~8-minute lane's
pass/fail verdict becomes unrecoverable. The log lives at
`$HOME/temp/.apra-fleet-tests/test-slow-lane.log` -- deliberately the SAME
throwaway root the smoke-test sandbox below uses (`$SANDBOX`, see `## Setup`)
even though this lane itself needs no sandbox, so a later `## Teardown`'s
`rm -rf "$SANDBOX"` sweeps this log up too as part of its normal cleanup; if
this pass's smoke-test portion is skipped, remove it by hand like any other
throwaway artifact under that path (`rm -f
"$HOME/temp/.apra-fleet-tests/test-slow-lane.log"`).

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/temp/.apra-fleet-tests"
SLOW_LANE_LOG="$HOME/temp/.apra-fleet-tests/test-slow-lane.log"
{ npm run test:slow --workspace=@apralabs/apra-fleet-se; echo "test:slow exit=$?"; } > "$SLOW_LANE_LOG" 2>&1
```

Reopen fix note: the exit marker MUST be inside the same
redirected group as the `npm run test:slow` command above -- if the `echo`
is placed after a `> "$SLOW_LANE_LOG"` redirect that only wraps the `npm
run` call, the marker is written to the terminal, not the file, and an
interrupted shell (the exact scenario this recovery path exists for) never
runs the `echo` at all, making the "recovered pass verdict" branch below
undocumented-but-impossible. The `{ ...; echo ...; }` grouping above
redirects both.

If this command's shell is interrupted (session restart, killed background
shell) before it completes, do NOT re-run the lane -- re-running risks
piling up a second orphaned process on top of the first. Instead, read the
verdict directly from the persisted log once the earlier process has
actually stopped: `tail -n 80 "$HOME/temp/.apra-fleet-tests/test-slow-lane.log"`
(`tail` is covered by the `Bash(tail:*)` permissions entry above) and treat
`test:slow exit=0` at the tail of the file as the recovered pass verdict, a
nonzero value as a recovered failure verdict, and the file's absence (or a
truncated file with no exit line) as "still running or was never
recoverable -- report status, do not fabricate a verdict."

An interrupted run's orphaned `npm run test:slow` / `node --test` child
processes are a KNOWN harness gap: `taskkill`, `kill -9`,
and `wmic process ... delete` (and even the read-only `wmic process ...
get`) have all been observed denied by the auto-mode permission classifier.
Per this repo's CLAUDE.md, a permission block must be SURFACED, not routed
around -- do NOT author a wrapper script, alternate binary, or any other
workaround whose purpose is to reap those processes past the block. Report
any such orphaned process to the operator as a surfaced permission block
and leave the cleanup to them out of band; this harness gap remains open
for that half.

To PROVE a before/after timing claim against a pre-fix commit (not just
assert one from memory), see `packages/apra-fleet-se/test/INTEG-SUITE.md`'s
"Reproducing on a pre-fix commit" section -- a `git worktree` at the old SHA
does not work here (no workspace `node_modules` of its own), the documented
recipe is a scratch clone plus its own `npm install`.

## Setup

First of the three sandbox-lifecycle sections for the smoke test (part 2
of the pass). Brings the sandbox up from nothing: fresh HOME, fresh
install, server running on the scratch port, toy repo cloned. It does NOT
register a fleet member and does NOT start a sprint. Those are the first
steps of the test itself (see `## Test scenario`), because member
registration is one of the things under test.

Prerequisites (a fresh checkout fails without these; a sprint workspace
normally has all three already):
<!-- history: apra-fleet stabilization Issue 43 -->
- `<repo-root>` cloned normally (`git clone`) -- `install`
  fails at its fleet-skill step if `packages/apra-fleet-se/apra-pm` is empty.
- `npm install && npm run build` has been run -- every step below invokes
  `node dist/index.js`.
- The runner's real session has a live Claude credential (see the
  credential-provisioning step in `## Test scenario`).

```bash
SANDBOX="$HOME/temp/.apra-fleet-tests"
export REAL_HOME="$HOME"

# Records this run's own start time, sibling to the sandbox (like the lock
# file below) so a later '## Teardown' can still read it after "$HOME" is
# deleted. Consumed by the dolt-sql-server reap's recency bound (see
# '## Teardown').
SETUP_STARTED_AT=$(date +%s)
echo "$SETUP_STARTED_AT" > "$SANDBOX.setup_started_at"

# Busy-check: claim the sandbox lock BEFORE touching anything below. Fails
# loud ('sandbox busy', non-zero exit) if another live run already holds it,
# instead of racing/clobbering it. sandbox-lock.mjs records ITS OWN
# process.ppid (this Setup shell's real, native OS pid) rather than reading
# $$ -- see scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs's file header for why $$ is unsafe
# under Git Bash on Windows.
node "<repo-root>/scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs" acquire "$SANDBOX" || exit 1

export HOME="$SANDBOX"
export USERPROFILE="$HOME"
export APRA_FLEET_PORT=18700
mkdir -p "$HOME"
cd "<repo-root>"
node dist/index.js install

# Stale-process guard: kill any process still bound to the sandbox's own
# scratch port (18700) before starting the server. Without this, a previous
# run's crashed or interrupted 'node dist/index.js' left bound to 18700
# causes this Setup's 'start' to hit EADDRINUSE; the real server silently
# rebinds to an OS-assigned port on EADDRINUSE instead of failing loud (see
# src/services/http-transport.ts / src/index.ts), which can leave the
# sandbox listening on the wrong port with no obvious error.
#
# scripts/kill-port.mjs (not a raw lsof-based loop) does the actual probe +
# kill: it is portable to Windows Git Bash (netstat/taskkill, no lsof), and
# hard-fails naming the missing probe tool instead of silently treating "I
# could not check" as "the port is free" -- a plain
# 'lsof -ti tcp:18700 2>/dev/null || true' loop reads as a pass on any host
# without lsof, which is exactly the false-success failure mode this
# replaces. Fails loud (non-zero exit) if the port is still occupied once
# the deadline elapses, or if this host has no supported probe tool.
node "<repo-root>/scripts/kill-port.mjs" 18700 "sandbox scratch port 18700" 5000 || exit 1

# Same stale-process guard, but for the toy app's dev-server port (3001,
# from 'npm run start:test' / 'cross-env PORT=3001'). This mirrors the
# bounded-retry kill-loop '## Reset' already uses for 3001: a prior
# interrupted run's toy-repo Deploy phase can leave its dev server bound to
# 3001, which would otherwise survive into this run's own '## Test
# scenario' and make its Deploy phase fail with 'listen EADDRINUSE :::3001'.
# Unlike the 18700 case the toy dev server just dies rather than silently
# rebinding, but this guard still fails loud (non-zero exit) instead of
# proceeding, matching the shape of every other port guard in this
# playbook. Runs before 'node dist/index.js start' like the 18700 guard
# above, and after the sandbox lock is acquired.
node "<repo-root>/scripts/kill-port.mjs" 3001 "toy app dev-server port 3001" 5000 || exit 1

node dist/index.js start

# Re-point the lock at the sandbox's own long-lived fleet-server PID (not
# this Setup shell, which exits once this code block finishes) -- the
# server stays up through ## Test scenario until ## Teardown stops it, so
# this is what keeps the lock a true liveness signal for the rest of the run.
node "<repo-root>/scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs" mark-server-started "$SANDBOX" || exit 1

git clone https://github.com/Apra-Labs/fleet-e2e-toy "$HOME/toy-repo"
```

Seed a git identity into the sandbox HOME immediately after the override
above: a fresh `$SANDBOX` has no `.gitconfig`, so without this `bd init`'s
seed commit fails (exit 128, surfaced as a "failed to commit beads files"
warning) and the toy sprint's doer fails at its very first `git commit`.

```bash
git config --global user.name "integ-smoke-runner"
git config --global user.email "integ-smoke-runner@apra-fleet.invalid"
```

`REAL_HOME` preserves the runner's real (pre-sandbox) home directory for the
`## Test scenario` credential-provisioning step below -- it is the only place
downstream that still needs to read anything from outside `$SANDBOX`.

Before handing off to the test: verify the server is actually bound to the
sandbox's scratch port. `node dist/index.js status` exiting 0 alone is NOT
sufficient here -- the server silently rebinds to an OS-assigned port on
EADDRINUSE instead of failing loud (see the stale-process guard comment
above and `src/services/http-transport.ts` / `src/index.ts`), so a runner
that only checks the exit code could hand off against the wrong instance
without ever noticing. Read `server.json` directly (the authoritative
source `status` itself reads -- `SERVER_INFO_PATH` in `src/paths.ts`,
`$HOME/.apra-fleet/data/server.json` once `HOME` is overridden to
`$SANDBOX` above) and assert its recorded port is exactly `18700`, failing
loud (non-zero exit, clear message) otherwise:

```bash
node dist/index.js status || {
  echo "Setup: 'node dist/index.js status' exited non-zero -- server did not" \
       "come up." >&2
  exit 1
}
ACTUAL_PORT="$(node -e '
  const fs = require("node:fs");
  const path = require("node:path");
  const p = path.join(process.env.HOME, ".apra-fleet", "data", "server.json");
  const info = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p, "utf8"));
  process.stdout.write(String(info.port ?? ""));
')"
if [ "$ACTUAL_PORT" != "18700" ]; then
  echo "Setup: server.json reports port '$ACTUAL_PORT', not the expected" \
       "sandbox scratch port 18700 -- the server likely silently rebound" \
       "after finding 18700 occupied (EADDRINUSE). Refusing to hand off to" \
       "the test against the wrong instance." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### Seed the sandbox beads DB (structural isolation, no bootstrap, no neutralize)

Adopts the e2e suite's own technique (see
`packages/apra-fleet-se/apra-pm/e2e/run-e2e.mjs`): seed the sandbox's local
beads DB straight from the git-committed `.beads/issues.jsonl` already
sitting in the clone above, rather than pulling from the real
`fleet-e2e-toy` Dolt remote. This wires every remote the sandbox will ever
talk to as sandbox-local throwaway BEFORE the local Dolt DB is created, so
the real `fleet-e2e-toy` remote URL is never adopted into the sandbox's git
or beads config.

First, point the sandbox clone's git `origin` at a sandbox-local bare
mirror of its own just-cloned content -- never the real `fleet-e2e-toy`
URL -- so `bd init`'s auto-provisioned Dolt remote (a side effect of the
next step) can only ever derive a sandbox-local remote:

```bash
TOY_REPO="$HOME/toy-repo"
GIT_MIRROR="$HOME/.apra-fleet-toy-origin.git"
rm -rf "$GIT_MIRROR"
git clone --bare "$TOY_REPO" "$GIT_MIRROR"
git -C "$TOY_REPO" remote set-url origin "file://$GIT_MIRROR"
```

Then seed the local beads DB from that git-tracked JSONL (no Dolt history
pulled from anywhere) via the guarded script below -- NOT `bd init` / `bd
dolt remote` by hand. It wires `sync.remote` to a second, dedicated
sandbox-local directory (kept separate from `$GIT_MIRROR` above, since
Dolt's `file://` remote writes its own storage into its target directory)
and hard-asserts every path resolves inside the sandbox root before
mutating anything, refusing outright (a named `[sandbox-seed guard]`
failure, zero mutations) if not: an earlier ad-hoc inline seed once
rewired the HOST repo's `sync.remote` to a sandbox path and aborted the
sprint when the sandbox was deleted -- this guard exists specifically to
make that impossible.

```bash
node "<repo-root>/scripts/sandbox-seed-beads.mjs" --sandbox-root "$HOME" --toy-repo "$TOY_REPO"
```

Verify none of the three remotes (`.beads/config.yaml`'s `sync.remote`,
the sandbox clone's `bd dolt remote list --json`, its `git remote get-url
origin`) ever resolve outside the sandbox root or reference
`fleet-e2e-toy`:

```bash
node "<repo-root>/scripts/check-sandbox-sync-remote.mjs" "$HOME/toy-repo"
```

### Boot the fleet-sprint supervisor

The toy sprint runs THROUGH a real supervisor instance
(`packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/serve.mjs`), not the direct `apra-fleet
workflow fleet-sprint` CLI, so this smoke test exercises the same
reservation-ledger / member-dispatch / HTTP-API path a real production
sprint launch actually uses (see `fleet-supervisor` skill guidance).

Isolate the supervisor's own service data directory from any real,
already-running supervisor on this machine -- `FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR` (read by
`ledger.mjs`/`history.mjs`/`spawner.mjs`) is NOT covered by the `HOME`
override above, so it must be set explicitly:

Note: by this point in `## Setup`, `HOME` (and `USERPROFILE`) are already
overridden to the sandbox root (see the `export HOME="$SANDBOX"` earlier in
this section) -- every command below uses `$HOME`, never `$SANDBOX`
directly, matching the convention the rest of `## Setup` already uses
(e.g. `GIT_MIRROR="$HOME/..."` above).

```bash
export SUPERVISOR_PORT=18701
export FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.apra-fleet-se-data"
# Owner-scopes this instance's dolt-orphan-sweep to the sandbox (see the
# hazard note below). Every member this supervisor can enumerate lives
# under the sandbox HOME, so its ephemeral dolt sql-servers do too.
export FLEET_SE_SWEEP_OWNER_DATA_DIR="$HOME"
mkdir -p "$FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR"
```

**dolt-orphan-sweep cross-instance hazard -- now fixed in code, and still
time-bounded as belt-and-braces.** The supervisor's `dolt-orphan-sweep`
seam (`packages/apra-fleet-se/src/supervisor/dolt-orphan-sweep.mjs`) scopes
`listMembers()` to whatever fleet server this process's `HOME` resolves to
(the sandbox's own, per the override above -- so it will only ever
enumerate `toy-doer`), but its actual probe/kill command USED to be a
MACHINE-WIDE process scan filtered only by port range (`13300-13400`) and
process age (`DEFAULT_MAX_AGE_MS`, 10 minutes) -- NOT by which supervisor
instance owns the process. That is mitigation option (a) from the bead, and
it has now LANDED as a code-level scope fix: `buildSweepCommand()` takes an
owner data-dir prefix, and `bin/serve.mjs` wires it from the
`FLEET_SE_SWEEP_OWNER_DATA_DIR` export above. With it set, BOTH shell
families (the win32 PowerShell `-like` clause and the POSIX `awk
index($0, owner)` clause) additionally require the candidate's
`--data-dir` to sit under the sandbox root, so this instance cannot kill a
different, live supervisor's ephemeral server. The seam is opt-in on
purpose: the ephemeral server's `--data-dir` is the MEMBER's beads data dir,
which for a real remote member has no relation to the supervisor's own data
dir, so scoping it unconditionally would silently turn the production sweep
into a no-op.

Three residual limits keep the old time bound worth having:

* Under `dolt-settle.mjs`'s `unknown` status-parse fallback the spawned
  command line carries only the RELATIVE default data dir, so it matches no
  prefix at all. That direction is fail-safe -- the sweep skips rather than
  kills a foreign process -- but it means the owner-scoped sweep is INERT
  for that case, exactly the blind spot `scripts/reap-sandbox-dolt.mjs`
  covers in `## Teardown` with a recency bound instead.
* The scope fix depends on the export above actually being in this
  supervisor's environment; a run that boots the supervisor by hand without
  it is back to the machine-wide scan.
* `FLEET_SE_SWEEP_OWNER_DATA_DIR="$HOME"` under Git Bash is an MSYS-style
  POSIX path (e.g. `/c/Users/x/...`), and `bin/serve.mjs` used to pass it
  straight to Node's `path.resolve()` on win32, which mangled it into a
  nonexistent path (`/c/Users/x` -> `C:\c\Users\x`) and made this instance's
  owner scope silently match nothing while still logging a confident scope
  claim. `bin/serve.mjs` now normalizes an MSYS-style path to its native
  Windows form before resolving it and warns loudly if the resolved prefix
  does not exist on disk, but a future direct caller of `path.resolve()` on
  an MSYS path bypassing that normalization would reintroduce the same
  silent-inert failure mode.

So the time bound stays, now as belt-and-braces rather than the only
defence: the sweep runs on EVERY tick of its `DEFAULT_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`
(5-minute) timer once started, with no immediate first pass -- so as long
as this sandbox's supervisor process never lives to see a single tick, the
sweep never runs at all during this test. `SUPERVISOR_STARTED_AT` below
records the boot time, and this bound is HARD-ENFORCED, not merely
asserted: `## Test scenario` step 4's sprint poll loop stops polling and
shuts the supervisor down itself once uptime reaches 280s (before the
300s/5-minute tick), rather than relying on its 360s poll deadline plus the
~30s boot time never crossing 300s in practice (they can -- 30s boot + 360s
poll is ~6.5 minutes). That 280s stop is deliberately KEPT as-is; it also
bounds how long a stuck toy sprint may run. `## Teardown`'s
`SUPERVISOR_UPTIME >= 300` check remains as a belt-and-suspenders
after-the-fact confirmation.

**Stale-process guard: kill any process still bound to $SUPERVISOR_PORT
(18701) before starting.** Mirrors the 18700 guard above and the `## Reset`
guard for port 3001: on `EADDRINUSE` the supervisor's `server.once('error',
...)` handler rejects `start()` rather than silently rebinding
(`packages/apra-fleet-se/src/supervisor/server.mjs`), but a plain
readiness-loop against the port cannot tell "our new process bound the
port" apart from "a leftover supervisor from a prior crashed/interrupted
run is still answering here" -- the identity check below closes that gap
for the boot itself, but only if the port is free to bind on first try.

```bash
node "<repo-root>/scripts/kill-port.mjs" "$SUPERVISOR_PORT" "supervisor port $SUPERVISOR_PORT" 5000 || exit 1

node "<repo-root>/packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/serve.mjs" --port "$SUPERVISOR_PORT" \
  > "$HOME/supervisor.log" 2>&1 &
SUPERVISOR_PID=$!
SUPERVISOR_STARTED_AT=$(date +%s)
# Marker files live NEXT TO the sandbox (mirrors "$SANDBOX.lock"'s placement
# above), not inside it -- so a later '## Teardown' can still find them even
# though it deletes "$HOME" (== "$SANDBOX" here) wholesale.
echo "$SUPERVISOR_PID" > "$SANDBOX.supervisor.pid"
echo "$SUPERVISOR_STARTED_AT" > "$SANDBOX.supervisor.started_at"

# Identity-checked readiness: GET /api/health returns the answering
# process's OWN pid (server.mjs), so require it to match the NEWLY-BOOTED
# process's own pid rather than accepting "something answered" on the
# port. This is compared against the pid server.mjs itself logs on boot
# ("[supervisor] listening on http://localhost:<port> (pid N)",
# server.mjs), NOT against $SUPERVISOR_PID/$! -- under MSYS/MinGW bash
# (Git Bash on Windows, which this playbook targets), $! is a
# bash-internal pid that never equals the native process's own
# process.pid (confirmed: a backgrounded node process reported $!=10954
# while its own process.pid was 117404), so comparing HEALTH_PID to
# $SUPERVISOR_PID can never match there and this readiness loop would
# always time out and kill the supervisor it just booted. Parsing the
# boot log for the process's own reported pid keeps both sides of the
# comparison native, which is what makes it identity-safe: a plain
# 'curl -sf .../api/members' readiness loop would false-positive against a
# foreign supervisor already bound to this port -- our process would then
# die (EADDRINUSE) while the test proceeds to drive someone else's
# supervisor, whose HOME/FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR are the real machine's, not this
# sandbox's, and whose uptime already exceeds the dolt-orphan-sweep's
# 5-minute tick. `kill -0`/`kill -9` below still use $SUPERVISOR_PID (the
# MSYS pid) -- that IS the correct pid space for bash's own liveness/kill
# builtins, even though it is the wrong pid space for this identity check.

## Reset

A faster alternative to Teardown + Setup between test runs in the same
session. It restores the toy repo and its beads state to pristine without
reinstalling or re-cloning, using the same e2e-pattern reset the e2e suite
uses on this toy repo (see `packages/apra-fleet-se/apra-pm/e2e/run-e2e.mjs`): reset the git
working tree to the sandbox-local mirror's `main`, then throw away and
re-seed the local beads DB from the git-tracked JSONL. The git `origin`
remote wired during `## Setup` (the sandbox-local `$GIT_MIRROR`) is
untouched by `git reset`/`git clean` -- remotes live in `.git/config`, not
the working tree -- so it stays sandbox-local across every Reset with no
re-wiring needed.

Before the git reset, this also kills any process still bound to the toy
app's dev-server port (3001, from `npm run start:test` / `cross-env
PORT=3001`): a prior abandoned attempt's background dev server (started by
that attempt's own toy-repo fleet-sprint Deploy phase) can otherwise
survive a Reset into the next attempt and cause `listen EADDRINUSE :::3001`
in the next Deploy phase. The kill step polls with a bounded
deadline (re-killing anything still bound each pass) and fails loud before
the git reset ever runs if the port is still occupied once the deadline
elapses -- a single fire-and-forget kill (the original approach) does not
reliably free a port a resumed/interrupted-attempt process is still
holding.

**Reset also stops and reboots the sandbox supervisor.** `## Setup`'s
dolt-orphan-sweep mitigation is a per-process uptime bound (the sweep only
fires once its 5-minute-tick timer has run at least once), so a supervisor
that survives across `## Reset` into a second test run in the same session
accumulates uptime across BOTH runs -- a Reset-and-rerun can push a
supervisor that individually looked fine each run past the 5-minute tick
without either run's own Teardown ever seeing it. Rebooting on every Reset
resets `SUPERVISOR_STARTED_AT` (and hence the uptime clock `## Teardown`
checks) so the accepted mitigation actually holds across repeated
Reset-and-rerun cycles, not just a single Setup-to-Teardown run. This
reuses the same identity-checked stop as `## Teardown` and the same
identity-checked boot as `## Setup` -- see those sections for the
rationale behind each check.

`--mode reset` re-seeds through the same `[sandbox-seed guard]` path
assertions as `## Setup` -- it is the ONLY sanctioned entry point for beads
seeding/rewiring in this playbook. It wipes the local Dolt DB and re-inits
it from the git-tracked `.beads/issues.jsonl` the `git reset --hard` above
just restored, so the canary `gh-toy-4ef` (`## Test scenario` step 2)
reappears with no separate re-provisioning step, and the re-init succeeds
every time with no `--discard-remote` needed.

## Teardown

Runs after every test run, pass or fail. It stops the server and deletes
the sandbox entirely, so no state accumulates or drifts from a fresh
install between runs.

```bash

# before the fleet MCP server further down -- a concurrent run's Setup
# readiness loop is now identity-checked (see '## Setup'), but stopping the
# outgoing supervisor before releasing the lock still closes the window
# where the lock is free (signalling "safe to acquire") while port 18701 is
# still held by this run's dying instance; releasing the lock first would
# let a new run's kill-port.mjs guard race this shutdown. This also
# confirms the dolt-orphan-sweep time bound documented in ## Setup actually
# held for this run (a loud warning, not a failure: the sweep is now
# owner-scoped in code to $FLEET_SE_SWEEP_OWNER_DATA_DIR -- see ## Setup's

# in its port range, which this sandbox's own dolt processes never are by

`tests/regression-playbook-sandbox-lifecycle.test.ts` is an automated,
pass/fail regression suite for the Setup busy-check, the Setup/
Teardown stale-port guards above, Teardown's dolt-sql-server reap, and the
cross-instance time-bound mitigation documented above -- run it via `npx
vitest run tests/regression-playbook-sandbox-lifecycle.test.ts` whenever this
sandbox lifecycle changes. It drives the real `scripts/sandbox-lock.mjs`,
`scripts/kill-port.mjs`, and `scripts/reap-sandbox-dolt.mjs` CLIs/functions
against throwaway sandboxes and OS-assigned ports; it does not run the live
Setup/Teardown sequence end to end (no real `node dist/index.js
install/start`, no network clone) -- that remains this file's job, run for
real by `regression-test-runner`.

`tests/regression-playbook-port3001-guard.test.ts` is the same kind of
automated, pass/fail regression suite, scoped to the toy app's dev-server
port (3001) guard in `## Setup` above and the documented Teardown rationale
for not separately reaping it -- run it via `npx vitest run
tests/regression-playbook-port3001-guard.test.ts` whenever that guard
changes. Same scope limits as the suite above: it drives the real
`scripts/kill-port.mjs` CLI against throwaway dummy listeners and OS-assigned
ports, never the real HOME or a real toy dev server.

## Test scenario (informational)

The smoke test itself: what `regression-test-runner` does with the
environment `## Setup` provides. Marked informational because it applies
judgment and assertions (find the canary, run a sprint, verify the
outcome), not a fixed copy-paste block like the three lifecycle sections.
Every step is now shell-drivable -- no MCP tool is required to run the
scenario.

1. Register one member pointed at `$HOME/toy-repo`, using the isolated
   `HOME`/`APRA_FLEET_PORT` from Setup, via the `register-member` CLI
   subcommand (Bash, not the `register_member` MCP tool).

   ORDER MATTERS: run step 3a's credential FILE write BEFORE this
   registration. `register-member` launches the member's live interactive
   claude session immediately; if credentials do not exist yet, that
   session comes up "Not logged in" and stays that way -- writing the
   credentials file afterward does not heal it. Step 3b (member-scoped
   provisioning) requires the member to already be registered, so it runs
   after this step. Execute in this order: 3a -> 1 -> 2 -> 3b -> 4.

   ```bash
   node dist/index.js register-member --type local --name toy-doer \
     --path "$HOME/toy-repo" --llm claude
   ```
2. The canary is fixed, not looked up: `gh-toy-4ef`, the toy repo's minimal
   "Add a --version flag to the CLI" issue, labeled `integ-canary` in the
   git-committed `.beads/issues.jsonl` that `## Setup` (and `## Reset`) seed
   the sandbox's local beads DB from directly -- no Dolt-remote tag lookup,
   no `bd import` reconcile, and no self-provisioning fallback. Confirm it
   came through the seed and is open:

   ```bash
   cd "$HOME/toy-repo"
   bd show gh-toy-4ef
   ```

   If this fails (issue missing, or not open), the seeded fixture itself
   is broken -- fail loud per step 5/6 below rather than silently self-
   provisioning a replacement. The canary is deliberately the simplest
   possible issue: one obvious task, one obvious change, one objectively
   checkable outcome, so the toy sprint's planner has no scope to invent.
3. Provision LLM credentials for the `toy-doer` member -- without this,
   step 4's Planner dispatch fails auth. Use the CLI auth path documented
   in `docs/mcp-tools.md` ("apra-fleet auth (CLI)"), not the
   MCP `provision_llm_auth` flow: `regression-test-runner` has no MCP
   tools available (see "Adding new features to this test" below).

   **3a. Seed the persistent secret store (run BEFORE step 1's
   registration).** Resolve the token from the runner's own ambient Claude
   credential -- its `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var if set, else
   `claudeAiOauth.accessToken` from its real, pre-sandbox
   `$REAL_HOME/.claude/.credentials.json` (see `REAL_HOME` in `## Setup`)
   -- store it as `secure.INTEG-TOY-DOER-TOKEN`, then also write it to a
   credentials file so step 1's interactive session comes up already
   logged in.

   NEVER include the refresh token: refresh-token rotation is
   server-side, so a sandbox process that refreshes with a COPIED refresh
   token invalidates the operator's real, live session -- this has
   expired the operator's login twice. Seed only
   `accessToken`/`expiresAt`/`scopes`.

   ```bash
   SECRET=""
   if [ -f "$REAL_HOME/.claude/.credentials.json" ]; then
     SECRET=$(node -e "
       const fs = require('fs');
       const c = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(process.argv[1], 'utf-8'));
       const o = c.claudeAiOauth;
       if (o && o.accessToken) {
         const { refreshToken, refreshTokenExpiresAt, ...probeSafe } = o;
         process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(probeSafe));
       }
     " "$REAL_HOME/.claude/.credentials.json")
   fi
   if [ -z "$SECRET" ]; then
     SECRET="${CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN:-}"
   fi
   if [ -z "$SECRET" ]; then
     echo "No ambient Claude credential found. Run '/login' in a real" \
          "session first, or export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, then re-run" \
          "this step." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   printf '%s' "$SECRET" | node dist/index.js secret --set INTEG-TOY-DOER-TOKEN --persist -y
   node dist/index.js auth --oauth --llm claude secure.INTEG-TOY-DOER-TOKEN
   ```

   **3b. Provision the member directly (run AFTER step 1's registration --
   it looks the member up by name). This is the path step 4's dispatch
   actually uses.**

   ```bash
   node dist/index.js auth --oauth --member toy-doer secure.INTEG-TOY-DOER-TOKEN
   ```

   Verify immediately, so a broken provisioning step fails loud here
   instead of after 5 wasted Planner dispatch retries in step 4:

   ```bash
   node "<repo-root>/scripts/check-toy-doer-credentials.mjs" toy-doer "$SANDBOX"
   ```
4. Launch the toy sprint THROUGH the supervisor's HTTP API
   (`POST /api/sprints` on `$SUPERVISOR_PORT`) instead of the direct
   `apra-fleet workflow fleet-sprint` CLI, matching how a real
   production sprint is actually launched (fleet-supervisor skill
   guidance). No `--skip-dolt-push` equivalent is needed: with the
   sandbox's `sync.remote` neutralized per `## Reset`, the engine's D-push
   pre-gate refuses to issue any `bd dolt push` regardless of launch path.
   If the sprint plans more than a couple of tasks for the canary's
   single-flag scope, that is itself suspicious and worth a bug bead.

   Note: the supervisor's launch body (`createSprintController`'s
   `launch()` in `src/supervisor/api.mjs`) does not currently forward a
   per-request dispatch-timeout override the way the CLI's
   `--dispatch-timeout-s` flag does -- a dispatch on this path runs under
   the engine's default (1 hour), not the CLI path's bounded 15 minutes.
   The bounded poll deadline below (6 minutes -- leaves headroom in the
   playbook's overall 10-minute budget for the ~30s supervisor boot and
   Teardown's own stop/reap steps) is what actually keeps THIS test's wall
   time bounded; a genuinely hung dispatch still fails this step loud via
   that deadline rather than the engine's own timeout. This gap is worth
   its own follow-up bead if the supervisor API grows a timeout field
   later.

   `SPRINT_BRANCH` gets a per-run timestamp suffix (not a fixed literal) so
   step 5 below can still check out the exact branch this launch used, but
   a Reset-and-relaunch within the same session (`## Reset` now reboots the

   Hard-enforces the `## Setup` dolt-orphan-sweep mitigation: this loop
   stops itself and shuts the supervisor down BEFORE uptime reaches the
   sweep's 300s/5-minute tick, rather than only asserting boot (~30s) +
   this 360s poll deadline never crosses it (they can -- 30s + 360s is
   already past 300s, `## Teardown`'s own `SUPERVISOR_UPTIME >= 300` check
   only warns after the fact). `SUPERVISOR_STARTED_AT` is read from the
   marker file `## Setup`/`## Reset` wrote, not a shell variable, since
   this may be a separate script invocation from the one that booted it.

   The marker is validated BEFORE the deadline is computed. Without that
   guard, a missing/empty/non-numeric marker (Setup partially failed, or
   this step run as its own invocation before Setup wrote it) makes `cat`
   yield nothing, `UPTIME_DEADLINE` evaluate to a bare `280` -- decades in
   the past -- and the loop exit 1 on its very first pass with the
   sweep-tick message, sending the operator to investigate a timing
   problem that does not exist. The guard fails with the real reason and
   names the marker file instead.

   ```bash
   if [ ! -f "$SANDBOX.supervisor.started_at" ]; then
     echo "Test scenario: supervisor started-at marker file" \
          "'$SANDBOX.supervisor.started_at' is missing -- ## Setup (or" \

5. Assert the canary issue is now closed and `$SPRINT_BRANCH` (the branch
   step 4 launched, `smoke-uof6-<timestamp>`) has a commit. Because the
   canary's deliverable is concrete, also verify it functionally when the
   canary is the "--version flag" issue: in `$HOME/toy-repo`, run
   `git fetch origin` FIRST -- the sprint's push lands on the sandbox-local
   `$GIT_MIRROR` (this clone's `origin`, wired in `## Setup`), not directly
   in this working copy, so `git checkout "$SPRINT_BRANCH"` without
   fetching first fails with "unknown revision" even though the branch
   exists on `origin`. After the fetch, check out `$SPRINT_BRANCH` and run
   the toy CLI with `--version`, confirming it prints a version string and
   exits 0. If any assertion fails, fail loud: file a bug bead per
   "Reporting failures" below. Do not silently reset and move on -- this
   repo treats sprint-run surprises as signal.
6. Hand off to Teardown regardless of the assertion's outcome.

### Smoke evidence output fields

The generic `regression-test-runner` output schema leaves `smokeEvidence`
target-defined. For this repo's own dispatches, populate it with exactly
these three fields, sourced from the checks above:

- `versionStdout` -- verbatim stdout of the toy CLI's `--version` run from
  step 5.
- `canaryStatus` -- the `status` field from `bd show gh-toy-4ef` (step 2),
  e.g. `"closed"`.
- `toyRepoHeadSha` -- the toy repo's head commit SHA after the toy sprint
  (step 4).

## Reporting failures

Regression failures are filed as STANDALONE, PARENT-LESS beads (`bd
create` WITHOUT `--parent`), titled `[regression][carry-over] <description>`:

```bash
bd create \
  --title="[regression][carry-over] <short description of failure>" \
  --description="Expected: <what should happen>
Actual: <what happened>
Test: <which test failed and its output>
Repro: <minimal steps to reproduce>" \
  --type=bug \
  --priority=<see priority rules below>
```

Priority rules:
- **P0**: system will not start or core path is completely broken
- **P1**: a sprint-goal requirement is explicitly not met
- **P2**: a requirement is partially met; degraded or inconsistent behaviour
- **P3**: quality, performance, or UX issue that does not block the core function

No `--parent` on purpose: the current sprint's completion gate walks its
scope tree via parent edges, so a parent-less bead is structurally
invisible to it. That is the point -- a regression failure is pre-existing
breakage, not new work item of the sprint that just ran, so it should
carry over to be picked up by a future sprint rather than blocking this
one's completion.

Before creating a new bug, search for duplicates across BOTH tags -- the
same underlying defect can surface here, or in `integ-test-playbook.md`'s
per-cycle pass, filed there under `[integ]` instead:
```bash
bd search "[carry-over]"
bd search "[integ]"
```
If an existing bug (either tag) covers the same failure, update its
description rather than creating a new one.

## Sandbox isolation: FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR and supervisor

`## Setup`'s "Boot the fleet-sprint supervisor" subsection DOES spawn a
real supervisor process (`bin/serve.mjs`) in the
sandbox, and `## Test scenario` step 4 drives the toy sprint through its
HTTP API (`POST /api/sprints`) rather than the direct `apra-fleet workflow
fleet-sprint` CLI. `FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR` is overridden to a sandbox-local
directory for that process (`$SANDBOX/.apra-fleet-se-data`) so its
reservation ledger/history/logs never mix with a real, already-running
supervisor's own data dir. That directory override is NOT, by itself,
enough to isolate the supervisor's `dolt-orphan-sweep` seam: `dolt-orphan-
sweep.mjs`'s `listMembers()` is scoped correctly (via the HOME-scoped
fleet server this supervisor process resolves against), but its probe/kill
command was a MACHINE-WIDE process scan filtered only by port range
(`13300-13400`, `SETTLE_PORT_RANGE`) and age (`DEFAULT_MAX_AGE_MS`), not by
`FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR` or supervisor instance. That is no longer open follow-up
work: mitigation option (a) has LANDED as a code-level scope fix --
`buildSweepCommand()` takes an owner data-dir prefix that both shell
families enforce, and `bin/serve.mjs` wires it from the deps-level seam
`FLEET_SE_SWEEP_OWNER_DATA_DIR`, which `## Setup` exports as the sandbox
root. See the dolt-orphan-sweep hazard note in `## Setup`'s supervisor-boot
subsection for the three residual limits (the relative-data-dir parse
fallback matches no prefix, the scope holds only where that export is
actually set, and the MSYS-path normalization seam) and for why the
time-bounded supervisor lifetime is kept alongside it as belt-and-braces
rather than removed.

## Adding new features to this test

When fleet-sprint or the installer gains a capability that changes what "a
working install" means (a new required member role, a new pre-sprint gate,
a new CLI subcommand), extend this test rather than writing a separate
ad-hoc script:

1. Add the new step to the `## Test scenario` list above, numbered, in the
   order it actually runs.
2. If it needs its own fixture (e.g. a second toy issue with a specific
   dependency shape), add that to `fleet-e2e-toy` directly, tag it the
   same way as `integ-canary`, and note the new tag here.
3. If it needs a genuinely different environment (a second member, a
   different port, a different topology), add another `## Setup`-adjacent
   step here rather than forking this file -- separate playbook files
   would drift apart and defeat the point of one source of truth.
4. Keep the <10-minute budget. If the new step is inherently slow, gate it
   behind an opt-in flag documented here rather than making every run pay
   for it.
5. Keep every section shell-drivable: `## Setup` / `## Reset` /
   `## Teardown` are fixed copy-paste command blocks, and `## Test scenario`
   is also all Bash (member registration uses the `register-member` CLI
   subcommand, not the MCP tool). This matters because `regression-test-runner`
   has only [Read, Bash, Grep, Glob] tools and cannot call MCP tools -- if a
   step genuinely needs MCP, add a CLI entry point for it first rather than
   assuming the runner can reach the MCP tool.

For new-feature-specific test coverage that runs every cycle against the
sprint branch working tree (not once-per-sprint sandbox checks), see
`integ-test-playbook.md` instead.
