/**
 * Idempotently seeds Claude workspace trust for `agent`'s work folder
 * (apra-fleet-eft.40.2). Wires the ensureWorkspaceTrusted(workFolder) provider-adapter
 * hook (apra-fleet-eft.40.1) into every call site that can leave a member's work folder
 * untrusted: register_member and update_member (once, at registration/update time) and
 * compose_permissions (on EVERY run, so an already-registered member -- e.g. one
 * created before this fix shipped -- is self-healed on its next compose).
 *
 * Best-effort and non-fatal: any failure (unreachable member, exec error, malformed
 * remote file) is caught and logged, never thrown -- a trust-seed hiccup must not
 * block registration, update, or permission composition. Non-Claude providers no-op
 * inside the adapter itself (see providers/*.ts), so this is cheap to call
 * unconditionally for every provider.
 *
 * @param agent The agent whose `workFolder` should be trusted, as resolved on the
 *   member (same path compose_permissions/deliverConfigFile already uses).
 * @param strategy Optional pre-resolved strategy (callers that already have one, e.g.
 *   compose_permissions, should pass it instead of paying for a second lookup).
 * @param tag Log tag identifying the call site (e.g. 'register_member').
