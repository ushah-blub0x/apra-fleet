// T2.1 (F4, D3 HARDENED): kb_import -- the trusted-channel write path that lets a
// warm local KB absorb a merged-in bible (.fleet/kb-canonical.json). The
// cold-seed in kb_session_prime is OUTPUT-ONLY and fires only under
// COLD_KB_MAX=3; it never writes the DB. This tool is that missing write path.
//
// Each bible entry routes through provider.capture() (the AUDN choke point) so
// dedupe/supersede/flag semantics apply, with an INTERNAL import mode (a second,
// non-deserializable capture() parameter -- R4) that (a) preserves the entry's
// bible confidence for NON-directive types (the SOLE clamp exemption -- the
// bible is a git-reviewed, human-merged artifact), stamping source='import';
// (b) forces type='user-directive' entries through the existing directive gate
// so they land as pending proposals, never active -- a bible cannot smuggle an
// active directive; and (c) suppresses provenance normalization so the tool's
// source='import' survives. After the loop it runs freshnessSweep() so imported
// entries whose basis does not match THIS worktree are staled immediately.
//
// TRUST BOUNDARY (LOW-1, honest statement): kb_import reads a caller-named local
// file. A local caller with tool access could hand-craft a bible and import it.
// This is equivalent in power to the already-MCP-exposed kb_promote surface
// (which walks any entry INFERRED->CONFIRMED one call at a time), so
// import-from-path adds bulk convenience, not a new privilege class. The
// "git-reviewed artifact" rationale only holds for the repo-resolved
// .fleet/kb-canonical.json; an explicit --path bible is CALLER-ASSERTED trust.
// The unforgeable tier remains user-directives, which are CLI-gated -- the
// directive gate quarantines them either way.
