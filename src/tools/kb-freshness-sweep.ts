// T1.3 (F2/D2 HARDENED, resolution R2): kb_freshness_sweep -- a bounded,
// full-KB BIDIRECTIONAL freshness sweep. Re-hashes the stored per-file basis of
// every entry that has one against the CURRENT worktree: a basis mismatch marks
// a fresh entry stale=1; a full basis match revives a stale entry that passes
// the D2 un-stale predicate (superseded, feedback-downvoted, and invalidated
// entries stay retired). This is the revival surface that kb_session_prime
// cannot be -- prime's candidate set excludes stale entries, so branch-switch
// revival requires a sweep, not just a prime. Invoked standalone by the PM
// reconcile flow and internally by kb_import.
