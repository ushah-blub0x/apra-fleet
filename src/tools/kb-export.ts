// (pm-kb), so no role's "no git operations" rule is violated by this
// automatic side effect.
// F4 (T1.6): repo path resolution precedence -- (1) explicit repo_path input,
// validated (must exist and be a directory) or kb_export refuses with a clear
// error; (2) validated session context -- this process's own working
// directory, used ONLY when repo_path is omitted, and put through the exact
// same existence + isDirectory check as an explicit path, never trusted
// blindly; (3) neither validates -- kb_export refuses with a clear error
// rather than silently writing relative to an arbitrary path. There is no
// bare process.cwd() fallback: the fallback tier is validated the same way
// explicit input is.
// T3.3 (F9a, D8): scope param -- 'project' (default, unchanged behavior) reads
// the PROJECT KB and writes .fleet/kb-canonical.json (as before); 'global'
// reads the GLOBAL KB (providers.global -- the shared kb.sqlite at
