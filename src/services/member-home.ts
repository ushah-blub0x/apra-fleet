/**
 * apra-fleet issue #390 -- the MEMBER's home directory, not the hub's.
 *
 * Every provider's `resolveSessionLogPath` / `resolveSessionLogDir` builds a
 * path under a home directory that must exist ON THE MEMBER'S MACHINE. Before
 * this module, no caller ever supplied one, so the providers fell back to
 * `os.homedir()` -- the HUB process's home. For any remote member that is the
 * wrong user (hub `alice` vs member `bella`), and the resulting path can never
 * exist on the member:
 *
 *   - Claude / Gemini: the stall poller reads a path that is never created, so
 *     `lastTimestamp` is always null, which the detector treats as "log not
 *     written yet -- do not count a stall cycle". Stall detection silently goes
 *     inert for that member.
 *   - AGY / OpenCode: those dispatches are provisional and rely on directory
 *     mtime polling. A wrong directory yields no signal at all, and the
 *     provisional baseline-timeout check then KILLS a healthy dispatch after
 *     the stall threshold -- a live false-positive.
 *
 * This module resolves the member's real home directory once per member and
 * caches it in memory (a home directory does not move for the lifetime of a
 * registration; the cache can be cleared explicitly if a member is re-registered).
 * Local members never probe -- they run as this process's own OS user, so
 * `os.homedir()` is already exactly right and their behavior is unchanged.
