// --- Per-run execution context (apra-fleet-unw.9, F11) --------------------
//
// Before this change, `FleetWorkflow` kept its "current run" state --
// `args`, `currentPhase`, `currentGroup`, `budget` -- as plain mutable
// instance fields. `WorkflowEngine.executeFile()` mutated `this.wf.args` on
// every call, and `phase()`/`group()` mutated a single shared
// `currentPhase`/`currentGroup`. That's fine for exactly one execution at a
// time, but breaks as soon as:
//   (a) two concurrent `executeFile()` calls run on the same `FleetWorkflow`
//       instance -- their `args` and phase attribution stomp on each other, or
//   (b) a single run's `parallel()` branches each call `phase()` with a
//       different value -- every branch (and every activity emitted from any
//       branch, including ones dispatched before the racing `phase()` call
//       resolves) ends up labeled with whichever branch's `phase()` call
//       happened to run last, not its own.
//
// `runStorage` (an AsyncLocalStorage) holds a small per-run store --
// `{ runId, args, phase, group, budget }` -- that is threaded automatically
// through the async call graph of a single `executeFile()` invocation:
//   - `WorkflowEngine.executeFile()` creates a fresh store via
//     `FleetWorkflow.runWithContext(args, entryFn)` and runs the whole script
//     inside `runStorage.run(store, ...)`. Every `agent()`/`command()`/
//     `phase()`/etc. call made anywhere inside that script -- including
//     across `await` boundaries -- automatically sees that run's store via
//     `runStorage.getStore()`, with no explicit threading required in the
//     workflow script itself.
//   - `parallel()` forks a *shallow copy* of the current store for each
//     branch before invoking its processor. `phase`/`group` are copied by
//     value, so a `phase()` call inside one branch only mutates that
//     branch's own copy and can never leak into a sibling branch or the
//     parent. `args`/`budget` are copied by reference, so budget spend is
//     still aggregated for the whole run and `args` stays consistent.
//   - Every activity/log/state event still carries the store's `runId`, so
//     even though the shared `EventEmitter` on `FleetWorkflow` fans events
//     out to a single global listener (the dashboard viewer subscribes
//     once), events from concurrent runs remain distinguishable.
//
// Direct, non-`executeFile()` usage (e.g. calling `wf.agent()`/`wf.phase()`
// straight off a `FleetWorkflow` instance, as several unit tests do) is
// preserved unchanged: when there is no active `runStorage` store (i.e.
// `runStorage.getStore()` returns `undefined`), every primitive falls back
// to the legacy instance-level fields (`this.args`, `this.currentPhase`,
// `this.currentGroup`, `this.budget`), exactly as before this change.

// --- Structured-output extraction (apra-fleet-unw.8) ---------------------
//
// The old extraction path used a single greedy regex,
// /\{[\s\S]*\}|\[[\s\S]*\]/, which grabs from the FIRST `{`/`[` to the LAST
// `}`/`]` in the whole reply. That fails as soon as a reply contains more
// than one JSON block, or trailing prose that happens to contain a brace --
// the regex swallows everything in between as one "candidate" and JSON.parse
// then throws on it. The functions below replace that with real bracket
// matching plus schema-directed candidate selection: prefer fenced ```json
// blocks; otherwise scan the raw text for every balanced top-level
// {...}/[...] span (tracking string state so braces inside string literals
// don't confuse the matcher); validate each candidate against the schema in
// the order found and return the first one that both parses and validates.
//
// NOTE (descoped, see agent() below for the full note): this is a
// client-side mitigation. The more robust fix -- enforcing the schema at the
// member/harness tool-call layer -- requires fleet-server changes.

 * @property {object} [schema] - JSON Schema for structured output. The dispatch-time
 *   `schema` passed here is the one actually ajv-validated against the member's
 *   response (see the compile/append/validate logic in agent() below) -- it is
 *   therefore authoritative at the member, per each persona's precedence clause
 *   ("if your dispatch prompt includes a JSON schema instruction, that schema is
 *   authoritative"). When `agentType` names a role that publishes its own output
 *   contract (apra-pm's role-owned schema design), callers MUST source this value
 *   from that role's published schema via their application-layer adapter (e.g.
 *   `contracts.mjs`'s `SCHEMAS.<name>` for auto-sprint) rather than authoring an
 *   independent, parallel definition here. Two independently-authored schemas for
 *   the same role is the double-specification hazard this single-source rule
 *   exists to prevent; the workflow layer itself stays generic and does not (and
 *   cannot) resolve or detect such drift -- see
 *   `docs/agent-schema-layering-proposal.md` (section 4, recommendation item 4;
 *   section 5.3) for the full rationale, and `docs/structured-errors-proposal.md`
 *   for the sibling design-doc pattern this cross-reference follows.
 * @property {string} [model] - Overrides model for this call
 * @property {string} [member_name] - Apra-fleet member to dispatch to
 * @property {string} [member_id] - Specific member UUID
 * @property {Record<string, string>} [substitutions] - Template substitutions for prompt
 * @property {number} [timeout_s] - Execution timeout (server-side INACTIVITY timeout:
 *   resets on every output chunk from the member CLI)
 * @property {number} [max_total_s] - Server-side HARD wall-clock ceiling for the dispatch,
 *   independent of activity. Also drives the derived client-side request timeout:
 *   deriveTimeoutMs (packages/apra-fleet-client/src/client/api.mjs) prefers max_total_s
 *   over timeout_s, so omitting it here caps the whole dispatch at timeout_s+grace
 *   client-side even when the caller intended a much larger total budget. Observed live
 *   (stabilization log Issue 10): this option was silently DROPPED from the payload, so a
 *   legitimate 15+ minute reviewer dispatch was client-timed-out at 930s while the remote
 *   session kept running.
 * @property {number} [max_turns] - Max turns for conversational tools
 * @property {'low'|'medium'|'high'|'xhigh'|'max'} [effort] - Effort parameter for fleet routing
 * @property {string} [agentType] - Agent persona to activate on the member
 * @property {boolean|string} [resume] - Resume the previous session on the member if one exists.
 *   A boolean `true` resumes the member's stored last session; a non-empty STRING resumes
 *   EXACTLY that session id (apra-fleet-eft.78.1 widened execute_prompt's resume input to
 *   boolean|session-id and made an explicit-id resume that cannot be resumed a TERMINAL
 *   error). The value is passed straight through to executePrompt's payload.resume.
 *   NOTE: the underlying ApraFleet client (packages/apra-fleet-client/src/client/api.mjs)
 *   defaults `resume` to `true` when omitted. The WORKFLOW layer overrides that: agent()
 *   explicitly sends `resume: false` unless the caller sets this option, so that
 *   workflow-authored prompts are self-contained by default and don't silently inherit
 *   state from a prior session. (F10 / apra-fleet-unw.3)
 * @property {(sessionId: string, meta: { member?: string, agent?: string, usage?: object }) => void} [onSessionId]
 *   Optional best-effort callback invoked with the resumable session id that execute_prompt
 *   promoted into structuredContent.sessionId (apra-fleet-eft.78.1), on a non-error dispatch
 *   that actually produced one. Lets a caller (the auto-sprint engine's per-role round-resume
 *   registry, apra-fleet-eft.78.3) record each dispatch's session id per (role, cycle) so it
 *   can resume the same role's session across rounds via `resume: <id>`. Never fires when the
 *   provider returns no session id (a capability signal, not a provider-name check); a throwing
 *   callback is caught and never breaks the dispatch. (apra-fleet-eft.78.3)
 * @property {number} [timeoutMs] - Client-side McpClient.request() timeout override (ms),
 *   passed through to ApraFleet.executePrompt. Not sent to the server. When omitted, a
 *   default is derived from timeout_s/max_total_s (see deriveTimeoutMs in
 *   packages/apra-fleet-client/src/client/api.mjs). (apra-fleet-unw.5)
 * @property {AbortSignal} [signal] - Optional AbortSignal, passed through to
 *   ApraFleet.executePrompt / McpClient.request. Aborting rejects the pending client-side
 *   wait for a response; it cannot cancel a job already accepted by the remote fleet-server.
 *   Groundwork for the cooperative-stop work in apra-fleet-unw.10 -- no /stop UI wiring here.
 *   (apra-fleet-unw.5)
 * @property {number} [schemaRetries] - Only meaningful when `schema` is set. Bounded number
 *   of repair re-asks to the SAME member after a parse/validation failure, before giving up
 *   and throwing AgentOutputError. Defaults to 2 (so up to 3 total dispatches: 1 original +
 *   2 repairs). Each repair re-ask FORCES `resume: true` (apra-fleet-02s.3) so the member's
 *   session already has the original prompt/schema and its own invalid output in context --
 *   the re-ask itself is a lean reminder containing only the ajv validation/parse errors
 *   plus a corrected-JSON instruction, not a re-embedding of the full original prompt/output.
 *   Each attempt emits its own activity:start/activity:end pair and is cost-accounted
 *   individually. (apra-fleet-unw.8)
 * @property {number} [busyWaitMs] - How long (ms) to keep waiting-and-retrying when the
 *   fleet server reports the member is busy ("execute_prompt is already running") before
 *   surfacing the busy AgentDispatchError. Defaults to 10 minutes. A busy member is
 *   almost always TRANSIENT-but-slow: observed live, a client-side transport drop
 *   orphans the in-flight remote session, which keeps running (and holding the member's
 *   one-dispatch-at-a-time lock) for however long its work takes -- minutes, not
 *   seconds -- then completes and releases the lock. A blind fixed backoff loses that
 *   race; polling until the lock actually frees wins it. Set 0 to disable (immediate
 *   throw, the pre-existing behavior). Each poll is a cheap re-dispatch attempt (the
 *   server rejects busy calls in milliseconds with no side effects).
 * @property {number} [busyPollMs] - Poll interval (ms) for the busy-wait above. Default 15s.
 * @property {string} [sprint_id] - Opaque sprint identity to pass straight through to
 *   execute_prompt's server-side reservation check (apra-fleet-eft.29.1). Callers that
 *   also reserve members via member_reservation (e.g. auto-sprint's
 *   createMemberReservationClient) should pass the SAME token here so a dispatch from
 *   the owning sprint is recognized as such even when the fleet server this call
 *   dispatches through is a pre-existing shared singleton with no per-sprint
 *   APRA_FLEET_SPRINT_ID of its own. Omit to preserve prior (env-var-only) behavior.

     *   live execution (partial replay, Claude-CLI style).
