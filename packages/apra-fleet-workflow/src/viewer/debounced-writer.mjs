// apra-fleet-eft.2.1: debounced run-state writer with flush-on-exit.
//
// This is additive to (not a replacement for) the existing
// terminal snapshot's write-once-on-end persistState() in
// src/viewer/index.mjs, which stays exactly as-is as the child
// crash-safety net. This writer coalesces bursts of rapid state changes
// (e.g. one per activity/phase/state event, see apra-fleet-eft.2.2) into a
// single write per debounce window, and always flushes synchronously
// before the process actually exits (end, SIGINT, SIGTERM, /stop).
//
// The target file path passed in today is a placeholder -- the real
// running/<runId>.json -> old_runs/<runId>.json layout under the
// service data directory is wired in a later task (apra-fleet-eft.2.3).

// apra-fleet-eft.20.1: single shared atomic-JSON-write primitive for every
// run-state persistence path in this package (the debounced writer below
// AND the terminal-snapshot persistState() in ../viewer/index.mjs). Centralizing
// this here guarantees two invariants that a hand-rolled/partial-patch writer
// could otherwise violate:
//   1. The full object is always serialized in ONE JSON.stringify pass -- no
//      code path ever splices/patches individual fields into previously
//      serialized text (the kind of string surgery that produced the
//      `"phase"":"Develop"` doubled-quote corruption in apra-fleet-eft.20:
//      a stray extra `"` inserted by an in-place field patch rather than a
//      single whole-object serialization). Because the input to
//      fs.writeFileSync is always the direct output of JSON.stringify(), the
//      written bytes are guaranteed to round-trip through JSON.parse().
//   2. The write is atomic: bytes land in a sibling temp file first, then
//      `fs.renameSync` (a single filesystem operation on POSIX) swaps it into
//      place, so a reader (or a crash mid-write) can never observe a
//      truncated/partial file -- only the old complete file or the new
//      complete one.
// The temp filename includes both the pid and a monotonic counter (not just
// Date.now(), which can collide when called faster than the clock's
// resolution) so concurrent/rapid writers targeting the same filePath never
// collide on the same temp path.
