# Positioning: apra-fleet-workflow vs. LangChain / LangGraph

**Audience:** Apra Fleet engineering
**Date:** 2026-07-14
**Question answered:** Should we replace `packages/apra-fleet-workflow` with LangGraph?
**Answer up front:** No. Do not replace. Selectively adopt four specific patterns (listed in Section 5). Rationale below is grounded in the actual source of this repo and the current (post-1.0, 2026) state of the LangChain ecosystem.

---

## 1. What each thing actually is

### apra-fleet-workflow (ours)

A ~1,500-line JS engine (`packages/apra-fleet-workflow/src/workflow/index.mjs`) whose unit of work is **a dispatch to a physically separate machine**. `agent(prompt, opts)` sends a prompt over MCP (stdio or streamableHTTP) to a named fleet *member* -- a local or SSH-reachable box running its own Claude/AGY/Codex/Copilot CLI -- and `command(cmd, opts)` runs a shell command there. On top of that dispatch primitive it layers:

- **Structured output**: ajv-compiled JSON-schema validation with a real bracket-matching extractor (fenced-block-first, string-state-aware balanced scan) and a **bounded schema-repair loop** -- on invalid output it re-asks the *same* member with a self-contained prompt embedding the original prompt, the member's own invalid output, and the ajv errors, up to `schemaRetries` (default 2) times.
- **Typed error taxonomy** (`errors.mjs`): `AgentDispatchError` (busy member, non-zero CLI exit, transport exception -- the LLM never answered) is deliberately distinguished from `AgentOutputError` (the LLM answered garbage), and dispatch failures are *never* fed into the repair loop, because "here's why your JSON was invalid" cannot fix a busy member. Plus `MemberNotFoundError`, `CommandError`, `FleetTransportError`, `BudgetExceededError`, `CancelledError`.
- **Concurrency primitives**: `parallel()` / `sequential()` / `pipeline()` with per-branch `AsyncLocalStorage` store forking so phase labels and journal sequence numbers are scheduler-independent.
- **Budget accounting**: per-member real pricing via the `get_member_model_pricing` MCP tool with tier-band fallback, never-fabricated usage (null cost when the fleet didn't report real tokens).
- **Journal + resume**: opt-in append-only JSONL journal; a crashed run resumes by replaying cached `agent()`/`command()` results keyed on (deterministic sequence, call type, member, prompt hash), switching to live execution at the first divergence (partial replay, Claude-CLI style).
- **Live dashboard**: SSE + polling HTML viewer with a phase/activity tree and a cooperative `/stop` (`requestStop()` -> per-run `AbortController` -> typed `CancelledError`).
- **SEA distribution**: the entire engine ships inside a Node SEA binary. Per `docs/workflow-subsystem-plan.md`, `apra-fleet workflow <name>` must run with **zero system Node installed** -- the binary self-extracts a runtime tree to `~/.apra-fleet/node_modules/` (workflow + client packages + a vendored ajv subtree, ~2.5 MB) and `import()`s the workflow from disk. This is a hard, CI-enforced invariant (the smoke test strips Node from PATH). The plan's decisive constraint: *any* design that loads two copies of the workflow package breaks every `instanceof` check across the engine/runner boundary.

The flagship consumer, auto-sprint (`packages/apra-fleet-se/fleet-sprint/runner.js`), runs a Plan -> Develop -> Review -> Deploy -> Integ-Test -> Harvest loop across planner/doer/reviewer/deployer/harvester roles, each role mapped to a (potentially different) physical member, with per-bead model-tier resolution done *server-side per member* so a mixed-provider fleet works. Critically, its coordination state is **not in the process at all**: it lives in beads, a git-backed dependency-graph issue tracker, driven via `bd` shell commands on the orchestrator member.

### LangChain / LangGraph (theirs, as of mid-2026)

Both hit 1.0 GA in October 2025 (Python and JS simultaneously), MIT-licensed, with a no-breaking-changes-until-2.0 stability commitment. LangChain 1.0 was rebuilt *on top of* the LangGraph runtime: its `create_agent` entry point supersedes the old `AgentExecutor`, and a middleware system (`before_model`, `wrap_tool_call`, `after_agent`, etc.) replaced the old grab-bag of chains. LangGraph is the substrate: a **StateGraph** of nodes and edges over typed state channels, compiled and executed in supersteps, with:

- **Checkpointing / durable execution**: a pluggable checkpointer (Memory, SQLite, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis) persists state after every superstep against a `thread_id`; a crash resumes from the last checkpoint. Sync and async persistence modes. (Worth noting: third-party critiques, e.g. Diagrid's, argue this is checkpointing rather than true durable execution -- side effects between checkpoints can replay -- which is honestly the same ambiguity our journal has with its `journal:ambiguous` started-but-never-finished records.)
- **Human-in-the-loop**: a first-class `interrupt()` primitive pauses the graph mid-run, persists state, and resumes on external input.
- **Streaming** (five modes, including token-level), **subgraphs**, **time-travel debugging**, a cross-thread **Store API**, and prebuilt supervisor/swarm multi-agent patterns.
- **Deployment model**: a Python or Node *library* embedded in your service, or **LangGraph Platform** -- a managed/self-hosted server runtime ($39/user/month Plus tier, $0.001 per node execution beyond quota; free self-hosted developer tier) -- typically paired with LangSmith for tracing.
- **Ecosystem**: very large; production users include Klarna, Replit, Uber, Cloudflare. LangGraph.js reached feature parity with Python at 1.0, but Python has roughly 10x the adoption.

## 2. Where we genuinely overlap

Be honest about this: on paper, LangGraph solves four of our five headline problems.

| Concern | apra-fleet-workflow | LangGraph |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrating multi-step agent flows | `agent()`/`command()`/`parallel()` in a plain ES-module script | StateGraph nodes/edges, or `create_agent` loop |
| Structured output + retry | ajv validation + bounded self-contained repair re-ask | provider-native structured output / `with_structured_output`, node retry policies |
| Crash resume (dispatch/execution state) | JSONL journal, prompt-hash replay keys, partial replay | checkpointer per superstep, `thread_id` resume |
| Observability | SSE dashboard, activity events, budget tracking | streaming modes, LangSmith tracing, time-travel |
| Cancellation / HITL | `requestStop()` cooperative abort | `interrupt()` pause/resume + abort |

If apra-fleet were a single-process Python service calling model APIs directly, building our engine instead of using LangGraph would be hard to defend in 2026. It is not that, and the differences below are structural, not cosmetic.

---

## 3. The four architectural distinctions that decide the question

### (a) Fleet-of-machines vs. graph-in-a-process

LangGraph orchestrates **nodes inside one runtime**. A "multi-agent" LangGraph system -- supervisor or swarm -- is multiple logical agents sharing one process, one event loop, one filesystem, one set of API keys, with the model call as the unit of work. Distribution exists only at the platform layer (a deployed LangGraph Server you call remotely), and even then each graph run executes within one runtime.

apra-fleet's unit of work is **an autonomous CLI agent session on a remote machine**: a doer member gets a prompt and then runs a full Claude-Code-style loop with its own tools, its own git worktree, its own provider auth, on its own hardware, for minutes to hours. The engine never sees the member's inner tool calls; it sees a dispatch, an eventual text/JSON result, and token usage. That is why the engine's hard problems are things LangGraph has no concept of: busy-member classification, per-member tier->model resolution across heterogeneous providers, per-member real pricing lookup, MCP transport failure vs. output failure, "the member accepted the job and will keep running even after we cancel client-side."

Rehosting auto-sprint on LangGraph would mean each graph node's body is... a call to our own MCP dispatch layer. LangGraph would be a control-flow DSL wrapped around the exact code we would still have to maintain. The hard 80% of `index.mjs` (dispatch classification, repair, pricing, journaling keyed on dispatch identity) does not disappear; only the easy 20% (loops, `Promise.all`, phase labels) gets a new spelling.

### (b) The SEA / zero-Node constraint is close to disqualifying on its own

`docs/workflow-subsystem-plan.md` makes "runs from the SEA binary with no system Node" a hard invariant, CI-enforced with Node stripped from PATH, and the whole runtime tree is +2.5 MB of verbatim, dependency-free-except-ajv `.mjs` files extracted to `~/.apra-fleet/node_modules/`.

- **LangGraph (Python)** is structurally incompatible. Full stop. We would be shipping a Python runtime inside or alongside a Node SEA binary. Not a candidate.
- **LangGraph.js** is *conceivably* shippable the same way we vendor ajv -- it is a JS library -- but the reality is ugly: `@langchain/langgraph` plus `@langchain/core` plus a checkpointer is a dependency tree measured in tens of megabytes and hundreds of packages, versus our current five vendored packages. The useful checkpointers pull native modules (`better-sqlite3`) or external services (Postgres/Redis) -- native modules are exactly what `build-sea.mjs` already has to externalize for ssh2/cpu-features, and an external DB contradicts "ops box with nothing installed." And the plan's decisive constraint bites again: a vendored-on-disk LangGraph plus any bundled copy inside `sea-bundle.cjs` reproduces the dual-copy `instanceof` hazard the current architecture was specifically shaped to avoid.
- Every future LangGraph upgrade becomes a re-vendoring + SEA re-verification exercise on three OSes.

So the honest assessment: LangGraph.js in the SEA model is not impossible, but it converts our cheapest architectural property (a pure-.mjs, zero-build, single-copy runtime tree) into a permanent packaging tax, for benefits Section 3(a) already shows are mostly at the wrong layer.

### (c) State model: the framework is substrate-agnostic; a workflow author's coordination-state choice is not a framework feature

The engine (`index.mjs`/`engine.mjs`) has no concept of business or coordination state at all -- it owns only an opt-in append-only JSONL **journal** that caches `agent()`/`command()` *dispatch results*, keyed on (deterministic sequence, call type, member, prompt hash). It knows "this dispatch, at this point in this run, previously returned this" and nothing more. A workflow script can journal-and-resume its dispatches while keeping its own coordination state anywhere -- in memory, in a file, in a database, in a LangGraph-style checkpointer -- without touching a line of the engine. The framework is, by design, state-model-agnostic; LangGraph, by contrast, owns an in-process state object that it checkpoints itself, keyed by `thread_id`.

That agnosticism is deliberate, not incidental: it's what lets each workflow pick a coordination substrate that fits its own shape. auto-sprint (Section 1), for instance, chose beads -- a git-backed tracker shared across machines and humans -- because its planner, doers, and reviewers run on different physical boxes and a human may intervene mid-sprint; that state has to survive the orchestrator process and machine, and be inspectable/editable with ordinary tools. That's a good call for auto-sprint's specific cross-machine, human-supervised shape, but it is auto-sprint's authorial choice made in `runner.js`, not something the engine provides or enforces. A LangGraph-style checkpointer would plausibly be a worse fit for that same problem (state moves from a shared, git-native substrate into a framework-private DB on one box) -- but that's a data point about auto-sprint's design, not evidence that the framework itself "has" a beads-based state model or wins on state versus LangGraph at the framework level. A different workflow on the same engine could adopt LangGraph-style checkpointing for its own state with no framework-level conflict.

### (d) Retry philosophy: classified repair vs. generic retry

LangGraph gives you node-level retry policies and checkpoint-based resume, plus provider-native structured output where the model API enforces the schema. What it does not have is our central insight, earned the hard way (see the `AgentDispatchError` docblock): **a dispatch failure and a bad-output failure need opposite handling**. Our repair loop re-asks with the member's own invalid output and the ajv error text -- targeted, cheap, usually recovers on repair 1 -- and is explicitly short-circuited for dispatch failures, which bubble up to the caller's coarser retry (e.g. runner.js's streak-dispatch retry). A generic "retry node N times" policy blurs exactly this distinction and, in our topology, would re-dispatch expensive multi-minute remote agent runs to fix what was actually a transport hiccup, or re-ask a busy member why its JSON was invalid. Our mechanism is more primitive in one respect -- see 5(2) -- but its *classification* is ahead of LangGraph's, not behind.

## 4. What replacement would actually cost vs. gain

**Cost:** rewrite of the engine and runner (the most battle-tested, comment-dense code in the repo -- nearly every block cites a fixed production bug: F5, F10, F11, N5, N6, N15, N18...); a permanent SEA packaging tax or abandonment of the zero-Node claim; migration of auto-sprint's own coordination-state model onto an alien, framework-private state abstraction (a cost specific to how auto-sprint chose to use the framework, not a framework-level cost); retraining; and adoption of a dependency whose center of gravity (Python, single-process API-calling agents, LangSmith/Platform commercial pull) points away from our problem.

**Gain:** a nicer control-flow vocabulary, `interrupt()`, better streaming, a bigger community -- every one of which is adoptable piecemeal (Section 5) without the rewrite.

**Verdict: the trade is clearly bad.** This is not reflexive not-invented-here: for a greenfield single-process agent product we should and would use LangGraph. But apra-fleet-workflow's value is not its loop constructs; it is the dispatch-layer semantics for a fleet of remote heterogeneous CLI agents plus SEA distribution, and LangGraph replaces neither.

## 5. What we should steal (concrete, prioritized)

1. **`interrupt()`-style human-in-the-loop.** Our only mid-run control is `requestStop()` -- all-or-nothing abort. LangGraph's pause-persist-resume-on-approval is genuinely better and maps cleanly onto machinery we already have: journal the pending approval as an activity, park the run, resume via the existing replay path. Natural first use: a human gate between Review and Deploy in auto-sprint.
2. **Provider/harness-level structured output enforcement.** LangGraph leans on model-API-enforced schemas instead of ask-then-parse-then-repair. Our own code already flags this as the real fix ("DESCOPED: enforcing the schema at the member/harness tool-call layer... requires fleet-server changes"). Prioritize that fleet-server work; keep the repair loop as fallback for members whose CLI cannot enforce.
3. **State-based (not prompt-hash-based) resume keys.** Our replay diverges the moment a prompt string changes, even trivially. LangGraph checkpoints *state between steps*, so cosmetic changes do not invalidate resume. A middle path, generically at the engine level: let a workflow script opt into journaling a caller-supplied business-state snapshot of its own choosing alongside the prompt hash, and allow "state matches, prompt changed" to be a warn-and-reuse rather than a hard divergence. Also adopt idempotency keys for dispatch (our plan already notes fleet-server-side keys as the true fix for `journal:ambiguous`).
4. **Middleware-shaped extension hooks.** Budget checks, pricing, journaling, and vetting are hardwired into `agent()`. A small before-dispatch / after-result hook chain (LangChain 1.0's middleware shape) would let auto-sprint-specific policies (per-role tiering, streak retries) move out of the core without forking it. Low urgency; do it next time `agent()` needs surgery anyway.

Also worth watching, not adopting: LangSmith-style tracing (we could emit OTel spans from activity events for pennies), and LangGraph's time-travel debugging as inspiration for a journal-diff viewer.

## 6. Recommendation

**Do not replace apra-fleet-workflow with LangGraph -- neither wholesale nor as an embedded control-flow layer.** The problem shapes differ at the foundation: LangGraph orchestrates logical agents inside one runtime, with the framework itself owning checkpointed execution state; apra-fleet-workflow dispatches autonomous agent sessions across physical machines and is deliberately state-model-agnostic about business/coordination state -- it only caches dispatch results, and leaves where a workflow's own coordination state lives entirely to the workflow author (Section 3(c)). That framework-level dispatch shape, plus a zero-Node SEA distribution invariant that Python LangGraph fails outright and LangGraph.js fails on cost-benefit (Section 3(b)), is what actually decides this -- not any claim that the framework "has" a superior state model. Replacement would rewrite our most hardened code to relocate the 20% that was never the hard part.

**Do** fund the four adoptions in Section 5, in that order -- items 1 and 2 are real capability gaps where LangGraph is legitimately ahead, and both fit our architecture without importing it. Revisit this decision only if the product ever grows a genuinely single-process, API-direct agent mode (e.g. a hosted control plane with no fleet); that hypothetical component could reasonably be LangGraph.js, living outside the SEA binary.
