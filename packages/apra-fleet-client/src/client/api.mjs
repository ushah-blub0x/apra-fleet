/**
 * @typedef {Object} ExecutePromptOptions
 * @property {string} prompt - The prompt to send to the LLM on the remote member
 * @property {string} [agent] - Optional agent name to activate
 * @property {number} [max_total_s] - Hard ceiling in seconds, measured from when the server
 *   receives the call (setup counts); exceeding it returns reason 'max_total_time'
 * @property {number} [max_turns] - Max turns for claude -p (default: 50)
 * @property {string} [member_id] - UUID of the member
 * @property {string} [member_name] - Friendly name of the member
 * @property {string} [model] - Model tier ("cheap", "standard", "premium") or a specific model ID
 * @property {boolean|string} [resume] - Resume the previous session if one exists. Defaults to
 *   true at this client/transport layer when the field is omitted entirely. NOTE: the
 *   FleetWorkflow.agent() workflow layer (packages/apra-fleet-workflow/src/workflow/index.mjs)
 *   always sends this field explicitly, defaulting it to `false` for workflow-authored
 *   prompts (see AgentOptions.resume there and apra-fleet-unw.3 / F10) -- so workflow
 *   callers effectively opt out of this client-level default unless they ask for resume.
 *   CALLER OBLIGATION: anything reaching executePrompt() WITHOUT going through that
 *   workflow layer must set this field explicitly. Omitting it is never neutral -- the
 *   server resumes the member's stored last session, so a one-off instruction silently
 *   lands in whatever unrelated (and possibly very large) conversation that member last
 *   ran. This client deliberately does NOT inject a default of its own: doing so would
 *   change the documented tool contract for every existing caller. State the intent at
 *   the call site: `true` to continue that member's prior session, a session-id string
 *   to continue a specific one, `false` for a self-contained dispatch.
 * @property {string} [session_id] - Optional explicit session ID to resume (shorthand alias for resume: "<sessionId>")
 * @property {boolean|string} [fork] - Branch a NEW session seeded from an existing one instead of continuing it in place. true = fork from the member's stored last session. A session-id STRING = fork from exactly that session. Mutually exclusive with resume (any non-default value) and with session_id.
 * @property {Record<string, string>} [substitutions] - Optional map of token name to replacement value
 * @property {number} [timeout_s] - Inactivity timeout in seconds -- always drives the stall detector's per-dispatch baseline threshold, measured against the member's own session transcript activity (default: 300). Per-provider, it ALSO arms the exec-level rolling timer against this dispatch's stdout/stderr channel for Codex and Copilot, which have no pollable transcript; Claude and AGY take that exec-channel ceiling from max_total_s instead; and OpenCode keeps BOTH signals armed at once (this exec-channel timer plus coarse log-directory-mtime polling, combined with OR semantics -- either advancing counts as not-stalled), since its transcript signal is directory-level only, not a per-turn file (see ProviderAdapter.execTimeoutSource() server-side)
 * @property {number} [expected_context_tokens] - Optional estimate of how many
 *   tokens this dispatch will add to the target session's context. When set (or context_size is
 *   set), the server compares it against the session's remaining context-window headroom BEFORE
 *   invoking the LLM: too little headroom rejects the call with {reason:
 *   "insufficient_context_headroom", detail: {demand, headroom, window}} and no spawn; a fit that
 *   lands inside the safety margin still proceeds but attaches a structured contextWarning. Wins
 *   over context_size when both are set. Omitting both fields disables the check entirely --
 *   pre-existing behavior is unchanged. Matches src/tools/execute-prompt.ts's
 *   expected_context_tokens field exactly (number, optional).
 * @property {'S'|'M'|'L'} [context_size] - Optional size-bucket shorthand for
 *   expected_context_tokens: S/M/L map to configured token estimates (fleet
 *   defaults, overridable via config.json's contextAdmission.sizeBucketTokens). Ignored when
 *   expected_context_tokens is also set. Matches src/tools/execute-prompt.ts's context_size field
 *   exactly (enum 'S'|'M'|'L', optional).
 * @property {number} [timeoutMs] - Client-side request timeout override (ms). Not sent to
 *   the server; consumed locally by McpClient.request(). When omitted, a default is derived
 *   from max_total_s/timeout_s (see deriveTimeoutMs in this file).
 * @property {AbortSignal} [signal] - Optional AbortSignal to cancel the client-side wait for
 *   a response. Not sent to the server. Aborting rejects the pending request locally; it
 *   cannot cancel a job already accepted by the remote fleet-server (see client.mjs).

 *   'secret_delivery_unavailable' (the member's stored credentials cannot be delivered

 *   paths. Read `usageLimit.resumeAt`/`resumeAtSource` to schedule a resume rather than
 *   re-parsing the failure text; `packages/apra-fleet-workflow` forwards this unchanged onto
