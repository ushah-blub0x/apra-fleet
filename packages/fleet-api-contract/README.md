# @apralabs/fleet-api-contract

Single source of truth for the apra-fleet **hub <-> dashboard** API contract.
Lives inside the `apra-fleet` monorepo as an npm workspace package (not a
dedicated repo) so it can be built/tested/versioned alongside the code that
issues and verifies the tokens it describes.

## Anchor schema: `JWTClaims`

`JWTClaims` (`{ iss, ws, sub, exp, role }`) is the central, load-bearing
export -- not just one schema among several. `ws` (workspace_id) is the hard
security boundary (see `docs/hub-spoke-master-plan.md` section 3 in the main
repo). Every other schema/endpoint that requires auth references
`JWTClaimsSchema` explicitly; none redefine an ad-hoc claims shape.

## What's in here

- `src/schemas/` -- Zod schemas: `Workspace`, `Project`, `Member` (whose
  provider enum includes `'none'`, for a plain command executor with no
  LLM), `JWTClaims`, `UsageRecord`, `ActivityEvent`, `Installer`,
  `AdminUser`.
- `src/endpoints.ts` -- one entry per route in the fleet-dashboard repo's
  "State & API sketch" (fleet-dashboard is a separate, private repo; only
  its published contract is visible here), with request/response Zod
  shapes. Auth-gated entries carry `auth: JWTClaimsSchema`.
- `src/openapi.ts` -- generates an OpenAPI 3.1 document from the SAME Zod
  schemas above (via `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi`) -- no hand-written,
  dual-maintained spec.

## Build & generate the spec

```bash
npm run build --workspace=@apralabs/fleet-api-contract
npm run gen:openapi --workspace=@apralabs/fleet-api-contract   # writes openapi.json
```

From the monorepo root these are also aliased:

```bash
npm run build:contract
npm run gen:openapi
```

## Publishing

Versioned semver release from this workspace package:

```bash
npm run build --workspace=@apralabs/fleet-api-contract
npm publish --workspace=@apralabs/fleet-api-contract
```

(Configure the target registry -- npm private registry or GitHub Packages --
via `.npmrc` / `publishConfig` before the first publish; `publishConfig.access`
is currently set to `public` as a placeholder and should be revisited once
the registry choice is finalized.)

## Consuming from fleet-dashboard

Depend on this package like any other npm dependency:

```bash
npm install @apralabs/fleet-api-contract
```

```ts
import { JWTClaimsSchema, MemberSchema, Endpoints } from '@apralabs/fleet-api-contract';
```

## Contract testing

Validate real handler responses against these schemas at runtime, not just
at the type level -- this catches wire-format drift (an extra or missing
field) that `tsc` cannot. See `tests/hub-service/installers.contract.test.ts`
in the main repo for the pattern: import the schema from this package, call
the real handler, and `Schema.parse()` the actual response.

Note that `src/hub-service/` is reference-only: fleet-dashboard is the sole
tier-3 persistence layer (see `docs/adr-tier3-ownership.md`). Its tests
remain as an executable specification of the wire-format and
security-isolation semantics this contract describes.
