const SERVE_USAGE = `
Usage: fleet-se serve [options]

Starts the always-on fleet-sprint supervisor. Runs until POST /api/shutdown or a
termination signal (Ctrl-C / SIGTERM).

Options:
      --port <port>   HTTP service port for the supervisor API. Default: ${DEFAULT_SERVICE_PORT}.
  -h, --help          Show this help message.

Environment:
  FLEET_SE_DATA_DIR                 Service data dir (ledger/history/logs).
  FLEET_SE_SWEEP_OWNER_DATA_DIR     Scope the dolt-orphan-sweep to ephemeral
                                    dolt sql-servers whose --data-dir is under
                                    this path, so an isolated supervisor
                                    instance never kills another instance's
                                    server. Unset = machine-wide (default).

 * apra-fleet-k06.1: compose BOTH launch-time overlap guards api.mjs's own
 * header comment (eft.5.2/eft.5.3) already describes as meant to run
 * together, as a standalone/exported factory so the composition itself --
 * not just each guard in isolation -- is directly unit-testable without
 * booting the real supervisor process (serveMain constructs its real
 * defaultMemberOverlapGuard/createScopeGuard collaborators and passes them
 * here; a test can inject fakes/stubs of the SAME shape instead).
 *
 * Member axis runs FIRST, preserving its exact pre-existing
 * behavior/message/status (409, field 'members') for every case it already
 * covered. The issue-scope axis runs second, over the SAME ledger; a
 * conflict throws the same ApiError(409, ...) shape the member guard uses
 * (field 'issue', a formatScopeConflict() message naming the conflicting
 * sprint(s) and overlapping bead ids) rather than an unhandled 500 --
 * registerSprintRoutes' onApiError only translates ApiError instances into a
 * clean JSON error response. Either guard failing rejects the whole launch; a
 * launch overlapping on neither axis still succeeds.
