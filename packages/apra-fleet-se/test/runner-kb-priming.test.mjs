//  1. Role subagents dispatched to a fleet member have the fleet MCP server
//     DISABLED (src/providers/claude.ts composePermissionConfig writes
//     mcpServers:{'apra-fleet':{disabled:true}}), so Step 0's

//
// Every kb_* call this engine makes carried repo_path ALONE. For a local member
// that is enough -- the fleet server can run git in that directory and derive
// the project slug from origin. For a REMOTE member it is not: the work folder
// is a path on another host, both of resolveProjectSlug's git probes fail
// against it, and the slug degrades to 'default'
// (src/services/knowledge/project-slug.ts). So every remote member in every
// sprint read and wrote one shared 'default' KB instead of its own project KB.
//
// apra-fleet-b4g.1 added repo_remote_url as the URL-based scope selector and
// apra-fleet-b4g.6 wired it into the execute_prompt auto-harvest path, but this
// engine's own prime/capture path was never in scope. apra-fleet-b4g.4 made the
// unreachable anchor degrade safely rather than corrupt freshness -- it does not
// route the call to the right KB.
//
// The URL is resolved from the repo path the caller already threads, NOT passed
// as a second argument at each call site. There are nine such sites across
// runSprintCycle/finalReview/harvest, and an extra positional argument at each
// is an invitation to omit one -- a forgotten argument reads as "no URL known",
// which is silently indistinguishable from a local member. Keying off repoPath
// makes the scope unforgettable: threading the path IS threading the scope.
