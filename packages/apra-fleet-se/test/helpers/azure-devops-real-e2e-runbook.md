# Real Azure DevOps E2E lane -- runbook

Companion doc for `azure-devops-real-e2e.mjs` (same directory). That module
is the opt-in GATE only -- it never provisions anything or touches the
network. This runbook covers everything a human needs to arm the lane: the
target, PAT scopes, how the secret gets into the fleet, rotation, and the
two required negative passes. This file is the source of truth for the lane.

No token value is ever recorded here or anywhere else in this repo. Every
reference below is either a secure placeholder (`{{secure.<name>}}`) or a
fleet credential-store *name* -- never a literal secret.

## Why this lane is opt-in

No default (non-opt-in) test suite may depend on a live external Azure
DevOps org. `resolveRealAdoE2eConfig()` in `azure-devops-real-e2e.mjs`
requires BOTH of the following to be explicitly set before it reports
`skip: false`:

| Env var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `APRA_FLEET_ALLOW_REAL_ADO_E2E` | Must be exactly `1`. The boolean "yes, I mean it" switch. |
| `APRA_FLEET_ADO_E2E_SECRET_NAME` | The fleet credential-store *name* already holding a working ADO PAT (see "Secret entry" below). No default -- an unset value always skips, even with the flag on, so a stale/unrelated credential can never be picked up by accident. |

Optional overrides (default to the target below when unset):

| Env var | Default |
|---|---|
| `APRA_FLEET_ADO_E2E_ORG_URL` | `https://dev.azure.com/apralabs` |
| `APRA_FLEET_ADO_E2E_REMOTE_URL` | `https://dev.azure.com/apralabs/e2e-fleet-testing/_git/fleet-e2e-toy` |

A scenario that wants a clean skip message should call `realAdoE2eSkip()`
and pass its return value straight into node:test's `{ skip }` test option
-- see the module's own doc comment for the exact contract.

## Target

- **Org / project / repo:** `apralabs` / `e2e-fleet-testing` / `fleet-e2e-toy`
- **HTTPS remote:** `https://dev.azure.com/apralabs/e2e-fleet-testing/_git/fleet-e2e-toy`
- **SSH remote (parseRepoRef fixture form):** `git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/apralabs/e2e-fleet-testing/fleet-e2e-toy`
- **PR list (where a passing run's PR must appear):** `https://dev.azure.com/apralabs/e2e-fleet-testing/_git/fleet-e2e-toy/pullrequests`

This is a private project under the real `apralabs` Azure DevOps org, not a
throwaway org -- see "Identity" below for why PATs are still minted from a
dedicated bot/test identity where possible.

## PAT scopes

Mint from **a dedicated bot/test Microsoft identity where possible** --
never a personal identity, because the revoked-PAT negative pass (below)
requires deliberately killing the credential mid-test.

| Pass | Scopes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Positive (standing) | Code: Read & Write (+ Pull Request Threads: Read & Write, if offered separately) | This is `skills/fleet/auth-azdevops.md`'s "development" role row. Scoped to org `apralabs` **only** -- never all-orgs. No Build/Release/Full. |
| Negative: scope-limited | Code: Read-only | Minted at test time, not kept standing. Exercises `provision_vcs_auth`'s 403/AUTH_DENIED path. |
| Negative: revoked | Same as positive, then revoked before use | Minted at test time, then explicitly revoked in the Azure DevOps UI before the negative-pass assertion runs. Exercises the 401/AUTH_EXPIRED path. |

Mint at: `https://dev.azure.com/apralabs/_usersSettings/tokens`.
Recommended expiration: 90 days for the standing positive-pass PAT (note the
date -- feeds the fleet's day-scale expiry-warning path, see
`skills/fleet/auth-azdevops.md`'s "Expiry Capture" section). The two
negative-pass PATs are throwaway and need no long expiration.

## Secret entry (out-of-band prompt only)

The PAT is **never** pasted into a prompt, a file, a commit, or any
LLM-visible text. It is entered exactly once, via the out-of-band
credential prompt that `credential_store_set` / `provision_vcs_auth`
triggers:

```
credential_store_set name=<APRA_FLEET_ADO_E2E_SECRET_NAME value, e.g. fleet-e2e-ado>
```

From then on, every reference is a secure placeholder:

```
provision_vcs_auth(member, provider: 'azure-devops',
                    org_url: 'https://dev.azure.com/apralabs',
                    pat: '{{secure.<secret name>}}')
```

Remote members have no secret store of their own -- the placeholder
resolves **hub-side**; the plaintext reaches a remote member only inside the
one executed command (deploy / verify), never in a log, prompt, or LLM
transcript. See design note C3 (secret-transport paragraph) on apra-fleet-5co8
for the full rationale.

## Verify (after provisioning)

```
execute_command  command="git ls-remote https://dev.azure.com/apralabs/e2e-fleet-testing/_git/fleet-e2e-toy HEAD"
execute_command  command="curl -sf -u :{{secure.<secret name>}} 'https://dev.azure.com/apralabs/_apis/projects?api-version=7.1'"
```

The placeholder is substituted already-escaped -- reference it bare, not
wrapped in an extra layer of quotes.

## E2E pass criterion

Run the toy sprint against the target repo above; success is a real,
visible pull request at
`https://dev.azure.com/apralabs/e2e-fleet-testing/_git/fleet-e2e-toy/pullrequests`.

The gated scenario itself -- provision, `git ls-remote` verify, then the
publish path that opens the real pull request above -- lives in
`../azure-devops-real-e2e.test.mjs` (same `test/` directory as this file's
parent), enable it exactly as described in "Why this lane is opt-in" above.

## Rotation (any time, no code change)

1. Mint a new PAT (same scopes, same org).
2. `credential_store_set name=<secret name>` again, entering the new value
   only via the out-of-band prompt.
3. Re-provision affected members / restart any long-running task that
   cached the old credential -- secure placeholders resolve at launch time,
   so a running process holding a stale deployed credential is not
   automatically refreshed.

## Notes

- The store-side `expiresAt` for the standing secret is deliberately left
  unset today: current credential-store semantics delete an expired entry
  on resolve, which is not the desired "warn, don't delete" behavior for
  this lane -- revisit once that lands (see design item C6 on apra-fleet-5co8).
- There is no implicit fallback secret name. Only the credential-store entry
  named by `APRA_FLEET_ADO_E2E_SECRET_NAME` at invocation time is used, so an
  unrelated ADO entry sitting in the store under some other name is never
  picked up by this lane.
