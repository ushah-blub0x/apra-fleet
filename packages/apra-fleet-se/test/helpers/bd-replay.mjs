// Record/replay layer for every `bd` CLI call the mock-sprint test suite
// issues (all of them flow through mock-sprint-harness.mjs's runCmd(), which
// delegates here). Three modes, selected by APRA_FLEET_BD_MOCK:
//
//   - replay (DEFAULT; unset or any value other than the ones below):
//     `bd ...` commands never spawn a process. Each scenario's calls are
//     answered from the committed JSONL recording under
//     test/fixtures/bd-recordings/<scenario>.jsonl -- the exact bytes a real
//     `bd` binary produced when the SAME test last ran in record mode.
//     Nothing is fabricated: if the test issues a command that has no
//     remaining recorded response, this module fails loudly with re-record
//     instructions instead of guessing a response.
//   - real (APRA_FLEET_BD_MOCK=0|false|off|no|real): every command runs the
//     real `bd` CLI via child_process.exec, byte-for-byte the pre-shim
//     behavior. This is what `npm run test:integration` uses.
//   - record (APRA_FLEET_BD_MOCK=record): same as real, PLUS every bd
//     call's { command, stdout, stderr, exitCode } is captured into that
//     scenario's JSONL recording. Refreshing fixtures == re-running the real
//     suite in record mode (`npm run test:record`) and committing the
//     result; there is no separate synthetic recording driver, so
//     recordings can never drift from what the tests actually issue.
//
// Replay matching is CONTENT-KEYED, not positional: recorded entries are
// indexed by their exact command string and served FIFO among identical
// commands. Rationale: scenarios with concurrent doer streaks (parallel()
// dispatches in runner.js -- e.g. the 3-bead golden transcript and the
// multidoer scenario) interleave their bd calls in a timing-dependent order,
// so the GLOBAL call order is not reproducible across runs; but each
// sequential command stream's RELATIVE order is deterministic (the same
// await chain issues them), so FIFO-per-command-string replays evolving
// state snapshots (e.g. successive `bd list --ready --json` calls) in the
// correct order while tolerating cross-stream interleaving. Drift in WHAT is
// issued (a changed/renamed/extra bd command) still fails loudly: there is
// no recorded entry for it.
//
// Non-`bd` commands (e.g. runner.js's `node -e "...existsSync..."` probes)
// are ALWAYS executed for real in every mode -- they are cheap and depend on
// real per-run tempDir paths, so recording them would be both useless and
// unstable.
//
// Scenario keying: every tempDir this suite creates follows the pattern
// `<family>-<tag>-<Date.now()>-<pid>` (see setup()/setupMinimal() in
// mock-sprint-harness.mjs and the local setup() helpers in
// golden-transcript*.test.mjs / budget-live.test.mjs). Stripping the
// trailing `-<millis>-<pid>` yields a stable, per-scenario key that is
// identical across runs, so the recording filename is deterministic while
// the tempDir itself stays unique per run. Scenario tags are unique across
// the whole suite, and `node --test`'s file-level concurrency runs each
// test file in its own process, so per-scenario recordings never contend.

// `bd dolt push`). Each such call spawns the real `bd` CLI, which cold-starts
// the embedded dolt engine (~seconds per spawn). The mock-sprint-*, golden-
// transcript* and budget-live scenarios each drive DOZENS of dispatches against
// a SINGLE local beads clone (their per-scenario tempDir) that has NO configured
// dolt remote, so every one of those pulls/pushes is a deterministic no-remote
// no-op returning the exact same benign-skip result. Re-spawning it per dispatch
// is what pushed 28/74 real-bd files over the 5-min single-file budget and the
// full suite to ~3228s (apra-fleet-eft.17).
//
// Fix: hydrate each fixture's dolt working copy at most ONCE per test-file
// process. The first `bd dolt pull` (and first `bd dolt push`) for a given clone
// -- keyed by cwd -- runs for real; its result Promise is cached and every
// subsequent identical dolt-sync command for that SAME clone is served from the
// cache WITHOUT re-spawning bd. Correctness is unchanged: with no remote the
// operation cannot vary for a given clone, and every bd read hits the local dolt
// store directly regardless of whether a redundant push ran. Distinct scenarios
// use distinct tempDirs (unique cwd), so each fixture still pays exactly one real
// round-trip per verb. Caching the Promise (not just the resolved value) also
// dedupes concurrent bracket calls from parallel doer streaks.
// apra-fleet-eft.54.5: also serves the stable `bd config get sync.remote

// files' dolt engines and the file blows past its per-file timeout. Cutting
// SPAWNS is therefore the only lever that moves the number; a timeout bump
// would just relabel the contention.
//
// Seven of that file's spawns are re-reads of a command whose answer cannot

// Every heavy mock-sprint/golden-transcript/budget-live scenario's setup()/

// before it ever creates a bead. Under real bd (APRA_FLEET_BD_MOCK=off, i.e.
// `npm run test:integration` / the real-bd suite apra-fleet-eft.17 is about)
// this is a full process spawn that bootstraps an embedded Dolt database
// from scratch -- real, repeated cost across 25+ setup() calls.
//
// Unlike a pre-seeded backlog (investigated and rejected for this same bead:
// fleet-e2e-toy's issues are a flat, unrelated toy backlog that doesn't
// exercise what these scenarios need), a BARE `bd init` with no issues yet
// created has no scenario-specific content at all -- every scenario runs the
// exact same command against an empty scratch dir, so its result is safe to
// produce once per test-file process and replicate onto every subsequent
// caller's own tempDir instead of re-running the real bootstrap.
//
// Verified (see task investigation): a copy of an already-`bd init`-ed
// directory tree, relocated to a differently-named destination directory,
// still behaves correctly under `bd list`/`bd create`/`bd update --parent`
// -- the embedded Dolt store's issue-id prefix is fixed at template-creation
// time and does not need to match the destination directory's name. No
// scenario asserts on the literal issue-id prefix string, only on the ids
// `bd create --silent` hands back at runtime, so this is behavior-neutral.
// apra-fleet-u87n.1 widens that amortization from ONE PROCESS to one
// TEST-RUNNER HOST. `node --test` runs every file in its own process, so the
// per-process template still paid a full ~10.7s dolt bootstrap per file -- 70+
// of them in the real-bd suite, eight of them firing SIMULTANEOUSLY at
// concurrency=8 as the lane starts, which is precisely when the disk is most
// contended. The template's content is identical for every process (a bare
// `bd init` into an empty dir), so it is published to a fixed path in the OS
// temp dir and reused by every later test-file process on the same host.
//
// Publication is atomic: the bootstrap runs into a `-staging-<random>`
// sibling and is then rename()d onto the final path, so a concurrent reader
// can only ever observe a COMPLETE template (a partially-bootstrapped dolt
// store is never visible under the final name). If two processes race, the
// loser's rename fails, it discards its staging copy and uses the winner's --
// bounded worst case, never a corrupt template.
//
// The path is keyed by the `bd` binary's own size+mtime fingerprint, so
// upgrading bd never reuses a template bootstrapped by the previous version;
// it simply starts a new one. APRA_FLEET_BD_TEMPLATE_KEY overrides the key
