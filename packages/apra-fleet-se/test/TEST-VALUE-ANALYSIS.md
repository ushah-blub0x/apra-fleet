## 0. What "64 suites" actually is (row-count correction)

Node's summary line `# suites 64` does NOT mean 64 top-level test groupings. The real
structure of the run is:

- **75 top-level run units**: 44 top-level `describe()` suites + 31 top-level bare
  `test()` calls (all the slow mock-sprint / golden-transcript / stall tests are bare
  `test()`s, which node counts under `tests`, not `suites`).
- The reported **64 suites** = those 44 top-level describes + **20 nested describes**
  (9 per-schema groups inside `contracts.test.mjs`'s "verdict schemas", 8 per-role
  groups inside the runner role-input tripwire, 1 `validateRoleInput (AC5)` group,
  and 2 "AC:" groups in the vendor-consistency file).

A 64-row table would therefore either double-count nested describes or omit every
slow test. The honest unit of analysis is the **75 top-level run units**, and that is
what the table in section 3 enumerates (nested describes are covered inside their
parent's row). Stated explicitly per the task instruction: the true top-level count
is 75, not 64.

## 1. Headline numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Wall clock (concurrency 4) | 16m 01s (958.8s) |
| Cumulative top-level test time | 48.1 min (2,886s) |
| Effective parallelism | 3.01x of the configured 4 |
| Slow units (>30s each) | 25 of 75 (33%) = 2,884.5s = **99.94% of all runtime** |
| Fast units | 50 of 75 (67%) = **~1.6s total** |

**The suite is not slow because it has too many tests. It is slow because 25 tests
each drive a full mock sprint against a REAL `bd` (Dolt-backed) CLI database.**
The proof is already inside the suite: `runner-arg-contract.test.mjs`'s
"runner.js mock-level execution" suite drives the complete runner.js sprint loop
(plan -> develop -> review -> deploy -> integ -> final review -> harvest -> PR)
in **163 ms** using a spy fleetApi with canned `bd` responses. The same loop against
a real `bd init` scratch DB takes 48-66s (budget-live's minimal 1-bead scenarios).
So >99% of each slow test's duration is `bd` child-process time (dozens of
`bd init/create/list/show/update/close/link` invocations at roughly 1-3s each on
Windows), not the logic under test.

(Attempted to directly benchmark raw `bd init`/`bd create` in a scratch dir to pin
the per-call cost; the permission layer blocked `bd init` -- surfaced per project
policy, not worked around. The inference above rests on the TAP durations of
scenarios with known bd-call counts, which is sufficient.)

## 2. Pareto analysis (the user's "99% value for 10% of tests?" question)

Honest answer first: **99% of protection at 10% of runtime is not achievable by
test selection alone**, because ~90% of the runtime sits in 25 tests that each guard
a DISTINCT, real, previously-observed regression class (N1, N3, N8, N9, N10, N11,
N12, A5, A6, pool-collapse, prompt drift...). Deleting time means deleting distinct
coverage -- until the `bd` cost itself is attacked (section 4, mechanism 2), which
DOES get you ~95%+ of protection at <15% of today's wall time.

Concrete cutoffs (cumulative test time; wall time estimated at concurrency 4):

| Profile | What runs | Cumulative time | Est. wall | Protection kept | What you give up detecting |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A. Fast lane | The 50 fast units only | ~1.6s | **~5-10s** | ~50% of regression classes | ALL end-to-end orchestration: stall/oscillation aborts, budget accrual, exit-condition bugs (orphaned/deferred/stale-verdict), doer-failure isolation, PR idempotency, golden prompt drift |
| B. Smoke profile | Fast 50 + 6 representatives: golden main (84s), happy-path (240s), doer-lies (86s), plan-reject (48s), zero-progress stall (141s), budget-trip (35s) | ~634s (22% of total) | **~5-6 min** | ~85-90% | Oscillation/thrash variant of stall, stale-verdict re-review, deferred/orphaned exit variants, PR-injection wiring, git/gh failure surfacing, multi-member pool, per-member pricing |
| C. Drop redundant only | Everything except: 3 determinism second-runs (golden det, 3bead det, happy-path run2), git-push-failure test (folded into gh-failure), duplicate resolveSchemasDir precedence suite | saves ~490s cumulative | **~12-13 min** | ~100% (determinism proofs demoted to nightly, not deleted) | Nothing per-commit; determinism regressions caught nightly instead of per-push |
| D. Scheduling only (recommended first) | Everything, files re-split + `--test-concurrency=8` | unchanged 48.1 min cumulative | **~6.5-8 min** | 100% | Nothing |
| E. Fake-bd (recommended investment) | Everything, mock-sprint scenarios on an in-memory bd shim + 1-2 real-bd canaries | est. <3 min cumulative | **~2 min** | ~95-98% (bd-CLI contract drift covered by canaries) | Real-bd interaction bugs outside the canary paths (e.g. a bd flag rename that only a non-canary scenario exercises) |

So the realistic Pareto: **~90% of protection at ~35% of wall time by selection (B)**,
**100% at ~45% by pure scheduling (D)**, **~95-98% at ~12% with the fake-bd
investment (E)**. D and E compose: D now, E when someone has a day to build the shim.

### Per-file runtime (the scheduling unit for `node --test`)

| File | Cumulative | File | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| mock-sprint-stall-detection | 7.8 min | happy-path | 5.2 min |
| mock-sprint-finalization-pr | 7.6 min | budget-live | 4.4 min |
| mock-sprint-develop-failures | 7.3 min | golden-transcript-3bead | 4.3 min |
| mock-sprint-exit-goalpriority | 6.4 min | golden-transcript | 4.2 min |
| mock-sprint-plan-contracts | 0.8 min | all 16 other files combined | ~2s |

### D-pull/D-push bracket caching (apra-fleet-eft.17.1)

Once eft.16 made the Plan 3.3 sync brackets run for real, every mock-sprint /
golden-transcript / budget-live dispatch paid two extra real `bd dolt pull` /
`bd dolt push` spawns (cold-starting the embedded dolt engine ~seconds each)
against a single no-remote scratch clone where they are deterministic no-ops.
That pushed 28/74 real-bd files over the 5-min single-file budget (worst 1543s)
and the full suite to ~3228s. Fix: `test/helpers/bd-replay.mjs` hydrates each
fixture's dolt working copy at most once per test-file process -- the first
`bd dolt pull` (and first `bd dolt push`) per clone (keyed by cwd) runs for
real and its result Promise is cached; every later identical dolt-sync command
for that same clone is served from cache without re-spawning bd. Correctness is
unchanged (no remote => the op cannot vary for a clone; every bd read still hits
the local dolt store) and the dispatch transcript is untouched (caching sits
below the dispatch/log point). Measured before/after (real-bd single-file
durationMs, worst offenders):

| File | Before | After | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| mock-sprint-doer-max-turns | 1,543,492 (3/3 pass) | 327,943 (3/3 pass) | ~4.7x |
| budget-live | 1,232,943 (5/5 pass) | 321,406 (5/5 pass) | ~3.8x |
| golden-transcript | 1,408,835 | 355,316 | ~4.0x |

golden-transcript's wall time drops ~4x too, but one of its two tests now
diverges in real mode for an unrelated reason (D-pull gating skips the no-remote
`bd dolt pull` the committed golden still expects -- passes in mock mode); see
apra-fleet-eft.17.3.

Perfect-packing lower bound on wall time: 12.0 min at concurrency 4, 6.0 min at
concurrency 8. Observed 16 min means today's packing loses ~4 min to file
granularity alone.

## 3. The full table (75 top-level run units, in run order)

Tiers: **CRIT** (unique, load-bearing, would ship a real bug class if deleted) /
**HIGH** (distinct real regression class) / **MED** (real but narrow, or partially
covered elsewhere) / **LOW** (cheap change-detector, marginal protection) /
**DUP** (redundant with a named sibling -- deletable with ~zero coverage loss).

(The HIGH total is dominated by 14 slow mock-sprint tests; the 15 fast HIGH suites cost 0.3s combined.)

## 4. Concrete time-reduction mechanisms (no protection loss unless stated)

1. **Scheduling (zero risk, do first): re-split the slow files and raise
   concurrency.** The wall clock is bounded by file-level packing: stall-detection
   (7.8 min), finalization-pr (7.6), develop-failures (7.3), exit-goalpriority (6.4)
   are the long poles, and effective parallelism is only 3.01x. Split each of those
   four files so no file exceeds ~5 min (e.g. one file per big test), and raise
   `--test-concurrency` to 8 -- these tests are child-process/IO-bound (bd
   subprocesses), not CPU-bound, and every scenario already uses an isolated temp
   dir, so they parallelize safely (watch only for Windows EBUSY noise in teardown,
   which is already retried). Expected wall: **~6.5-8 min** (perfect-packing bound
   at concurrency 8 is 6.0 min; the 4.9-min oscillation test is the new long pole).

2. **Kill the real-bd tax (the structural fix): an in-memory `bd` shim.**
   Every slow test's cost is `bd` (Go binary + embedded Dolt store) subprocesses:
   `bd init` per scenario plus dozens of create/list/show/update/close/link calls.
   Row #68 proves the entire runner loop runs in 163 ms when executeCommand returns
   canned bd output. The scenarios' assertions are about runner.js's orchestration
   (dispatch order, exit conditions, error types, command strings) -- not about bd
   internals -- so an in-memory bead store implementing the ~7 subcommands the
   runner and harness actually issue (init, create [-t/-p/--metadata/--silent],
   list [--json/--ready/--all/--parent/--status/--priority-max], show, update
   [--parent/--status], close, link), returning byte-plausible JSON, preserves
   nearly all their value. Keep the happy-path (#49) and golden main (#33) on real
   bd as CLI-contract canaries. Expected result: 22 mock-sprint tests drop from
   50-290s each to low seconds; wall **~2 min**. Cheaper intermediate variant:
   create ONE warmed `bd init` template dir per test file and `fs.cp` it per
   scenario -- removes the (likely most expensive) Dolt store creation from every
   scenario without faking anything.

   **IMPLEMENTED (2026-07-17), with one deliberate design change**: instead of a
   hand-written in-memory bd emulator returning "byte-plausible" JSON, the shim is
   a record/replay layer (`test/helpers/bd-replay.mjs`) -- every response it can
   ever return is a byte-for-byte capture from a real `bd` run of these same
   tests, so nothing is fabricated and format drift cannot be introduced by the
   shim itself. `APRA_FLEET_BD_MOCK` selects the mode: replay (default; recorded
   fixtures under `test/fixtures/bd-recordings/`, see the README there),
   `0`/`real` (real bd CLI, the pre-shim behavior; `npm run test:integration`),
   or `record` (real bd + refresh the fixtures; `npm run test:record`).
   `test/bd-recordings-fidelity.test.mjs` guards the recordings' integrity. The
   real-bd canary recommendation stands: `npm run test:integration` runs the WHOLE
   suite (including happy-path #49 and golden main #33) against real bd.

3. **Demote the three determinism second-runs to a nightly lane** (#32, #34, and
   run2 inside #49): each re-executes an identical full sprint purely to prove
   run-to-run stability, ~490s cumulative. Per-commit, the snapshot comparisons
   (#31/#33 vs committed golden files) already catch drift; true nondeterminism is
   a slow-moving property well served nightly.

4. **Delete the two DUP rows**: fold #47 (git push failure) into #46 (gh failure)
   as a second injected failure in one scenario (~70s), and drop one of the two
   resolveSchemasDir precedence suites (#19 vs #24, ~0s but removes a maintenance
   double).

5. **Scenario diet on the worst offender**: #60's filler dependency chain (5 beads,
   one unblocked per cycle) exists only to produce a rise-then-plateau closed-count
   history; 2-3 fillers produce the same shape for ~40% fewer cycles (~1.5-2 min
   saved). Similarly, budget-live's five tests run five full sprints where two
   sprints plus unit-level model-selection assertions would prove the same wiring
   (~2-3 min saved).

6. **Not recommended**: deleting any of the slow HIGH tests outright. Each maps
   1:1 to a real, previously-shipped bug (N1, N3, N4, N8, N9, N10, N11, N12, N18,
   A5, A6, hfs, pool-collapse) -- this suite is unusually honest in that respect;
   there is remarkably little dead weight among the expensive tests. The waste is
   in HOW they run (real Dolt-backed bd per scenario, duplicate determinism runs,
   file packing), not in WHAT they test.

## 5. Bottom line

- 50 of 75 test units cost ~1.6s total and are all worth keeping as-is.
- 25 units consume 99.94% of the runtime; ~23 of them guard distinct real
  regression classes and should not be deleted.
- The user's hypothesized "99% value at 10% time" is not reachable by selection,
  but IS effectively reachable by engineering: scheduling alone halves the wall
  clock to ~7-8 min with zero change in protection; a fake-bd layer (modeled on the
  already-existing 163ms spy-API suite) gets ~95-98% of today's protection at
  roughly 2 minutes.
- Single best next action: split the four >6-min files and run at
  `--test-concurrency=8` -- a ~10-line, zero-coverage-risk change that removes
  ~half the wall time today.
