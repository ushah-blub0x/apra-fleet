# fleet-sprint Engine Contract: CLI Flags and Issue-Scope Resolution

This is the wire/argument-level contract for the fleet-sprint engine: the
exact CLI flags `bin/cli.mjs` accepts, how they map onto the runner's own
`validateArgs()` contract (`fleet-sprint/runner.js`), and -- in detail --
the `--issue` scope-resolution algorithm (`bdListScoped()`), which is not
documented precisely anywhere else in this package.

For the full flag table (types, defaults, descriptions), preconditions
`main()` runs before any dispatch, and fleet-server/schema resolution, see
`docs/cli-reference.md` -- **do not duplicate that here**. This document
covers only:

1. The `--issue` -> `target_issues` mapping detail (a gap in cli-reference.md).
2. The runner's own `validateArgs()` contract, as distinct from the CLI's
   pre-validation of the same fields (two layers, same regexes).
3. The `--issue` scope-resolution algorithm (`bdListScoped()`), worked
   examples included.

## 1. `--issue` is comma-separated at the CLI, an array at the runner

`bin/cli.mjs` (in `parseCliArgs()`):

```js
const targetIssues = values.issue.split(',').map(s => s.trim()).filter(Boolean);
```

So `--issue epic-1,epic-2` becomes `['epic-1', 'epic-2']`, and this array is
forwarded to the runner as `target_issues` by `buildRunnerArgs()`.
**The CLI supports multiple target issues.** `--issue` is not a repeatable
flag (nothing in the option spec is declared `multiple: true`), so a second
`--issue` overwrites the first -- the comma-separated form is the only way to
pass more than one id.

The supervisor's `POST /api/sprints` endpoint takes the same shape: its
`issue` field is a string that `splitIssueIds()` comma-splits, trims and
filters before validating **each** id individually with `validateIssueId()`.
Because `ISSUE_ID_PATTERN` does not include a comma, that split has to happen
first -- handing the un-split `"a,b"` to `validateIssueId()` would 400. See
`packages/apra-fleet-se/docs/supervisor-api.md`. The raw runner arg
(`target_issues: ['a','b']`) is the third equivalent form.

## 2. Two validation layers, one set of regexes

Both `bin/cli.mjs` and `fleet-sprint/runner.js` validate issue ids and
branch names against the SAME patterns (`runner.js` exports
`validateIssueId`/`validateBranchName`; the CLI imports and reuses them --
single source of truth, not two independently-maintained regexes):

- `ISSUE_ID_PATTERN = /^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$/` -- letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-` only. No commas, no slashes, no spaces.
- `BRANCH_NAME_PATTERN = /^[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+$/` -- same, plus `/`.
- `GOAL_PATTERN = /^P[1-3](\/P[1-3]){0,2}$/` -- `P1`, `P1/P2`, `P1/P2/P3`, etc, checked only in the runner's `validateArgs()` (the CLI's `--goal` help text documents the same pattern but does not itself re-check it before forwarding).

The CLI checks these BEFORE opening the fleet MCP connection (defense in
depth: a malformed id never reaches a shell interpolation even if this CLI
layer were bypassed and the runner invoked directly -- which is exactly what
`fleet-sprint/runner.js`'s own `validateArgs()` re-checks, again, as the
final gate before any `command()`/`agent()` dispatch). Both layers throw the
same `[Arg Contract] Invalid issue id "..."` / `[Arg Contract] Invalid ...
branch name "..."` message shape.

### Runner's own `validateArgs()` contract (`fleet-sprint/runner.js`)

Called once, at the top of `main(context)`, on the raw `args` object passed
in (by the CLI's `engine.executeFile()` call, or directly by a test/other
caller). Rejects unknown keys outright (`KNOWN_ARG_KEYS` is an explicit
allowlist -- see the list in the source for every key the engine currently
recognizes, including test-only/programmatic-only keys like
`doer_worklist_mode` that have no CLI flag).

Required:
- `target_issues` (non-empty string array) OR legacy `target_issue` (string) -- at least one of the two; `target_issues` is preferred. Each entry validated with `validateIssueId`.
- `members` (non-empty string array, every entry a non-empty string).
- `branch` (string, `validateBranchName`).
- `base_branch` (string, `validateBranchName`).

Optional (defaults applied inside `validateArgs()`):
- `goal` -- default `'P1/P2'`; must match `GOAL_PATTERN`.
- `max_cycles`, `requirementsFile`, `roleMap`, `budget`, `dispatch_timeout_s`, `serviceUrl`, `run_id`, `assignee`, `doer_worklist_mode`, `resume_model_switch`, `worklist_effort_budget`, `azdevops_pat_secret_name`, `callTool` -- see `KNOWN_ARG_KEYS` in the source for the authoritative, currently-recognized set and which of these have a CLI flag vs. are programmatic-only.

An unknown key throws `[Arg Contract] Unknown arg(s): <keys>. Known args: <allowlist>.` immediately -- this is the fastest way to discover whether a given engine feature (e.g. `assignee`, `doer_worklist_mode`) is wired to a CLI flag yet: if `bin/cli.mjs` never sets it, it stays at its default forever for CLI-launched sprints.

## 3. `--issue` scope resolution (`bdListScoped()`, `fleet-sprint/runner.js`)

This is the algorithm that turns the sprint's target issue id(s) into the
set of beads every dispatch (planner, doer, reviewer) is allowed to see and
work. It backs every `bd list`-shaped query the engine issues internally
(ready beads, status checks, closure checks, etc) -- there is no other way
in or around it.

### Why it exists (not `bd list --parent`)

`bd list --parent <id>` accepts exactly one id per invocation (a
comma-joined list is treated as one nonexistent id and returns `[]`), and
it is single-level only -- it returns direct children, never grandchildren.
A level-3+ descendant of a target issue would therefore be invisible to
dispatch scope, not just to the dashboard tree. `bdListScoped()` avoids this
by fetching the WHOLE project's beads once (`bd list --all --limit 0
--json` -- `--all` because closed issues are excluded by default, which
would orphan a closed node's subtree from discovery; `--limit 0` because
the default row cap could silently truncate a large scope) and then doing
the descendant walk itself, in memory.

### The algorithm

1. Fetch every bead in the project once per call (cached/coalesced across
   concurrent callers via `fetchAllBeadsShared()` / `allBeadsSnapshot`).
2. Build a `parent id -> [children]` map from every bead's `.parent` field.
3. **BFS from every target issue id** (`targetIssues`, i.e. every id passed
   via `--issue`/`target_issues`): starting with the target ids as the
   initial frontier, repeatedly add each frontier bead's children (any
   status, any depth) to `scopeIds` and to the next frontier, until no new
   ids are discovered. This finds every descendant at any depth, for every
   target, in one pass -- multi-target scopes are just the union, with no
   separate code path.
4. **Childless-leaf seeding**: after the BFS, for every target issue id
   that has NO children (`!childrenOf.has(id)` or an empty children array),
   add that id itself to `scopeIds`. The BFS only ever adds descendants,
   never the targets themselves, so without this step a sprint aimed at a
   single undecomposed issue would resolve to an EMPTY scope.
5. **A target WITH children is a pure grouping node**: its own id is
   deliberately left OUT of `scopeIds` (only its descendants are in-scope).
   It still shows up in the scope indirectly, because it is some child's
   `.parent`, and `readyLeafBeads()`'s decomposed-node guard already
   excludes any bead that is itself somebody else's parent from being
   selected as leaf work. The net effect: an epic/feature target is never
   independently dispatched as a work item, only its leaf descendants are.
6. If `scopeIds` ends up empty, `bdListScoped()` returns `[]` immediately
   (every subsequent `bd list` call for this sprint short-circuits to no
   results).
7. With no extra filter args (`bdListScoped('')`), the result is simply
   every fetched bead whose id is in `scopeIds`.
8. With filter args (e.g. `bdListScoped('--ready --json')`), a SECOND,
   project-wide `bd list <args> --limit 0` query is issued (because
   readiness and other bd-computed properties cannot be reliably
   replicated by an in-memory filter over the already-fetched snapshot),
   and its results are intersected with `scopeIds`. When the sprint has an
   `assignee` configured, `--assignee <id>` is appended to this query so
   two sprints working the same project never select the same bead.

### Worked examples

**Example A -- epic with a 2-level hierarchy.** Epic `X` has children `A`
and `B`; `B` has child `C` (a grandchild of `X`). `--issue X`:
- BFS frontier: `[X]` -> discovers `A`, `B` -> pushes `A`, `B` -> discovers
  `C` (child of `B`) -> pushes `C` -> no further children.
- `scopeIds = { A, B, C }`.
- `X` has children, so it is NOT added by the childless-leaf seeding step;
  `X` itself never appears in `scopeIds`.
- Result: the sprint's dispatch scope is `{A, B, C}`. If `A` and `C` are
  leaf tasks and `B` is itself decomposed (has child `C`), `readyLeafBeads()`
  further excludes `B` (it is `C`'s parent) -- only `A` and `C` are
  independently dispatchable leaf work; `X` and `B` are pure grouping nodes.

**Example B -- a single undecomposed issue.** Issue `Y` has no children.
`--issue Y`:
- BFS frontier: `[Y]` -> no children found -> `scopeIds` stays empty after
  the BFS.
- Childless-leaf seeding: `Y` has no children, so `Y` is added to
  `scopeIds`.
- Result: `scopeIds = { Y }`. The sprint's entire scope is just `Y` itself,
  and it is directly dispatchable as leaf work (nothing else has it as a
  parent).

**Example C -- multi-target union.** `--issue X,Y` (epic `X` as in Example
A, plus standalone `Y` as in Example B):
- The BFS frontier starts as `[X, Y]`; the walk and the childless-leaf
  seeding step both run per-target as described above, and results union
  naturally since `scopeIds` is a single `Set` accumulated across every
  target.
- Result: `scopeIds = { A, B, C, Y }`.

### Practical implication for `--issue`

Pointing `--issue` at an epic/feature pulls in its ENTIRE subtree (every
descendant, any depth, any status) as the sprint's working scope, but the
epic/feature node itself is never directly dispatched -- only its leaf
descendants are. Pointing `--issue` at a leaf (childless) issue scopes the
sprint to exactly that one issue. There is no flag to scope to "this node
only, not its descendants" when the node has children -- targeting a
grouping node always pulls in its full subtree.
