/**
 * DoltSync -- the SINGLE permitted dolt command surface for fleet-sprint.
 *
 * SCOPE / INVARIANT (apra-fleet-417.2, apra-fleet-417.2.1)
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Every `bd dolt pull` / `bd dolt push` this orchestrator ever issues, and
 * every dolt merge-conflict decision it ever takes, MUST go through this
 * module. No other file -- runner.js included -- may spawn a `bd dolt ...`
 * command directly, and no other file may re-implement classification, retry,
 * gating, or conflict handling for one. runner.js keeps only purpose-level
 * calls (syncBefore / syncAfter / status); the mechanics live here.
 *
 * WHY: before this module the same bracket logic was inlined in runner.js and
 * reached from ~12 call sites, so a fix to retry/gating/conflict behavior had
 * to be replayed at each of them and drifted in practice. One module with one
 * documented entry point per PURPOSE (not per command) makes that impossible.
 *
 * PUBLIC API (the only supported entry points -- see the bottom of this file)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   syncBefore(member, opts)  -- freshen `member`'s beads clone before it is
 *                                read from or dispatched (D-pull bracket).
 *                                `opts.readinessGate: true` (apra-fleet-417.5
 *                                rename of `healthGate`, ADR Decision 2)
 *                                selects the pre-flight beads-health variant,
 *                                which additionally composes the actionable
 *                                "beads DB diverged" diagnosis line.
 *   syncAfter(member, opts)   -- publish `member`'s beads mutations (D-push
 *                                bracket, mutex-serialized, with the single
 *                                bounded first-successful-pusher-wins
 *                                reconcile).
 *   status(member, opts)      -- read-only probe: is this clone actually wired
 *                                to a shared beads remote? Issues no dolt
 *                                command and never throws.
 *
 * FAULT-TOLERANCE POLICY (apra-fleet-417.3.1): syncBefore/syncAfter return a
 * STRUCTURED OUTCOME `{ ok, kind, degraded, degradedKind, detail, ... }` and
 * are DEGRADED BY DEFAULT -- an unresolved sync failure does not throw, it
 * reports `degraded: true` (with `degradedKind` carrying the ADR's
 * backend-neutral failure taxonomy, apra-fleet-417.5) and lets the sprint
 * continue. A call site that must still hard-abort says so explicitly with
 * `fatal: true` (and `readinessGate: true` implies it). See the "Structured
 * outcomes and the bounded DEGRADED-BUT-NON-FATAL path" section near the
 * bottom of this file.
 *
 * The lower-level primitives (doltPullBefore / preflightBeadsHealthGate /
 * doltPushAfter / classifyDoltFailure / extract*) stay exported because the
 * unit suites drive them directly and 417.2.2 migrates call sites onto the
 * purpose-based API incrementally; they are IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL of the three
 * entry points above, not a second supported surface.
 *
 * CONFLICT-RECOVERY DISPOSITION (docs/dolt-sync-redesign.md Parts 2.2/2.4)
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The old 3-tier ladder (dolt-recovery.mjs Path A, dolt-recovery-path-b.mjs
 * Path B, dolt-recovery-tier2.mjs Tier 2 + docs/dolt-tier2-runbook.md) is
 * RETIRED, not merely rewired. In production it could never resolve anything:
 * Path A threw its precondition guard on every invocation (no sql runtime was
 * ever injected at its call site), Path B was hard-disabled for a correct
 * reason, and Tier 2 only DISPATCHED an LLM -- it never verified, so
 * recoverDoltConflict() returned `ok: false` by construction, 100% of the
 * time. Worse, its teardown was an instruction step an agent could abandon
 * mid-procedure (apra-fleet-5mqg).
 *
 * It is replaced by ONE deterministic function: settleDoltConflicts()
 * (fleet-sprint/dolt-settle.mjs), total over every row-level conflict shape
 * this data model can produce -- no gates, no allowlist, no escalation, no
 * LLM -- with a real `finally` teardown. This module holds it as
 * `opts.settle`: a zero-argument callback (buildSettleCallback(), same file)
 * that RESOLVES on a verified recovery, because settle itself republishes and
 * verifies before returning.
 *
 * Where it is wired -- BOTH divergence terminals, not just the push side:
 *   - doltPushAfter()'s terminal, where a divergence outlives the bounded
 *     first-successful-pusher-wins reconcile (where the ladder used to sit).
 *   - doltPullBefore()'s diverged terminal, which had NO recovery at all: a
 *     clone wedged by an earlier failed reconcile used to hard-abort the next
 *     sprint at the readiness gate (preflightBeadsHealthGate delegates here,
 *     so it inherits the same self-heal).
 *   - repair(), the operator/tool entry point -- same one implementation.
 *
 * Kept unchanged on purpose: with NO `settle` callback wired, both brackets
 * behave exactly as before (the typed error propagates immediately), so the
 * degraded-by-default path (apra-fleet-417.3.1) and every existing call site
 * keep their prior semantics.
 *
 * ASCII only.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Dolt sync brackets: D-pull / D-push
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The beads database is a Dolt database that every member syncs through a
// shared remote, orthogonally to the git code branch. Where the git brackets
// keep each member's *code checkout* current, these keep each member's *beads
// clone* current: a D-pull before every dispatch/read that consumes beads
// state, and a D-push after every step that mutates it.
//
// The most divergence-sensitive read in the runner is the orchestrator's
// post-streak `bd show` verification (verifyDoerStreakClosed): a remote doer
// closes its beads in ITS OWN clone and D-pushes them, so without an
// orchestrator-side D-pull immediately before that read the orchestrator reads
// its own stale (still-open) copy and falsely marks every remote doer streak
// FAILED.
//
// Conflict policy, deliberately NOT per-conflict judgment: D-push is
// first-successful-pusher-wins. A member whose push is rejected is the loser
// and reconciles MECHANICALLY -- it D-pulls the winner's state (ours/theirs
// fixed by which clone is resolving, never a human/LLM decision) then re-pushes
// exactly once. A divergence that outlives that one bounded reconcile is a hard
// DoltDivergedError, never retried blindly -- the mirror of the git
// single-writer stance.
//
// Every `bd dolt` command is issued via the injected command() with an explicit
// member_name -- agents never sync beads themselves; the orchestrator brackets
// each dispatch. `command` is dependency-injected so unit tests can drive these
// helpers with a mock command() and no live Dolt server.

// DOLT_TRANSIENT_PATTERNS) are GONE -- classifyDoltFailure() below delegates
// to VCSModule.classifyFailure(raw, { provider: 'dolt' }), the ONE place VCS
// stderr is parsed. The 'dolt' provider (./vcs-providers/dolt.mjs) carries
// every one of those six tables VERBATIM, plus their own precedence (auth
// checked BEFORE diverged -- see that file's header for the live incident
// this ordering prevents, apra-fleet-spp), so this is a delegation, not a

// sync.remote probe memoization (apra-fleet-akuv)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `bd config get sync.remote --json` used to be spawned FRESH on every call --
// once per D-pull pre-gate, once per D-push pre-gate, once per status() probe,
// and every dispatch is bracketed -- which measured out at roughly 90-160
// spawns (about 0.6s each) per sprint re-reading a value that never changes
// mid-run. A codebase-wide search confirmed no production path in this package
// writes sync.remote during a live sprint; only test fixtures and one-time
// setup/seed scripts do. So the result is memoized PER MEMBER for the process
// lifetime, with explicit invalidation rather than a TTL (a TTL would re-add
// spawns for no real safety).
//
// WHAT IS CACHED, deliberately narrow: ONLY a positively parsed answer -- a
// clean JSON parse of the command's output. Every fail-safe path (command()
// threw, a failSoft error result, no output at all, unparseable output) reports
// "configured" WITHOUT caching, so a transient probe failure can never pin the
// fail-safe answer for the rest of the run; the next call re-probes. This
// preserves isMemberSyncRemoteConfigured's fail-CLOSED contract exactly.
//
// INVALIDATION -- three HARD seams that drop BOTH this memo and the member's
// recorded remote-tip fingerprint (see the invariant below), plus one SOFT
// seam that drops nothing and instead marks the member for a lazy re-check:
//   1. noteMemberCommand() -- called from the runner's central command()
//      wrapper; drops the entry for any `bd config set` / `bd dolt remote` /
//      `bd init` / `bd bootstrap` the ORCHESTRATOR issues against that member.
//   2. the auth self-heal path in runDoltStep(), when onAuthFailure fires for
//      a member (re-provisioning credentials can rewire the remote).
//   3. repair(), the operator/tool remediation entry point.
//   4. (soft) noteMemberDispatchCompleted() -- called from the runner's
//      central agent() wrapper the moment ANY dispatch to a member settles.
//      A dispatched agent runs its `bd` commands in its own session on the
//      member, never through the command() wrapper, so seam 1 cannot see an
//      agent-side `bd config set sync.remote`. This seam therefore marks the
//      member DISPATCHED-SINCE-VERIFIED; the memo stays, and is re-read
//      (one `bd config get`, a plain config.yaml read) only at the one
//      decision a stale answer could turn into stale DATA -- the moment a
//      D-pull is about to be SKIPPED on the strength of the fingerprint. See
//      noteMemberDispatchCompleted for why this is the right trigger and
//      why an unconditional per-dispatch wipe was replaced.
//
// INVARIANT: the hard seams forget the two per-member memos (this one and
// lastSyncedTips) TOGETHER. Any event that can rewire a member's remote or
// replace its local clone invalidates both; a seam that dropped only one
// would leave a fingerprint that was minted against the other, stale, answer.
// The fingerprint additionally carries the URL it was minted against, so a
// memo that is later re-read to a DIFFERENT url can never validate it.
//
// The same cache entry carries the remote URL, which the remote-tip
// fingerprint (see readRemoteDoltTip below) needs -- one probe answers both
// questions, so the fingerprint costs no extra `bd config get`.

 *
 * THE DESIGN DECISION (dolt sync budget review round 4). Round 3 made this
 * seam an unconditional wipe of both memos, on the argument that an agent
 * runs its `bd` commands in its own session (invisible to noteMemberCommand)
 * and might `bd bootstrap` / `bd init` / `bd config set sync.remote` the
 * member's clone. Combined with "a push never mints a fingerprint" (correct,
 * see doltPullBefore's section comment), that left the fingerprint EMPTY at
 * the start of every dispatch bracket -- the module's primary path -- and
 * re-spawned `bd config get` once per dispatch (the golden mock-sprint
 * transcript went from 1 probe to 14). The primary path then paid one
 * ls-remote MORE than before this feature existed and skipped nothing.
 *
 * The wipe was the wrong tool because the hazards it guarded are not what
 * they were assumed to be. Taking each agent-side event in turn, against
 * what bd actually does (verified against the beads source):
 *
 *   * `bd bootstrap` -- the one self-heal this repo's agent instructions
 *     prescribe ("database exists" -> retry with `--database <name>`) -- is
 *     NON-DESTRUCTIVE. With a DB present it validates and reports; it never
 *     replaces the clone. Where it does create a DB it CLONES it from the
 *     configured sync.remote, i.e. the result is current with the remote by
 *     construction. In neither case can a fingerprint that still equals the
 *     remote's tip describe a clone that is not at that tip. A surviving
 *     fingerprint stays TRUE across a bootstrap.
 *   * `bd init` REFUSES on an existing DB unless forced (`--reinit-local` /
 *     `--force`). A forced re-init yields a clone with an UNRELATED history:
 *     no `bd dolt pull` can bring it current (there is nothing to
 *     fast-forward), so skipping that pull changes nothing, and the clone's
 *     next push diverges into the terminals that already forget the tip and
 *     run settle. The fingerprint is not the deciding factor there either.
 *   * `bd config set sync.remote <other>` -- the ONE event where a skip would
 *     suppress a pull that WOULD have helped (the clone should now follow a
 *     different remote). This is handled, not accepted: the fingerprint is
 *     bound to the URL it was minted against, and a member marked here has
 *     its sync.remote RE-READ before any skip is taken on its fingerprint
 *     (confirmSkipAfterDispatch). A changed URL forgets the fingerprint and
 *     forces a real pull; an unreadable answer forces a real pull too.
 *
 * WHY LAZY, AND WHY ONLY ON THE SKIP PATH. A stale memo can only turn into
 * stale DATA at one decision: "skip this pull". Every other consumer fails
 * closed -- a wrong "configured" answer merely issues a real pull/push
 * against whatever remote bd itself has configured, which is the right
 * remote regardless of what we cached. So the re-read is paid exactly where
 * it buys correctness: once per skip-after-dispatch (one `bd config get`, a
 * plain config.yaml read with no Dolt engine start, instead of a real pull
 * that opens the whole chunk store), never per dispatch. A bracket whose
 * remote tip MOVED pays nothing extra; consecutive orchestrator-side reads
 * with no dispatch in between pay nothing extra. The golden transcript is
 * back to one probe per member per process.
 *
 * THE ABSENT CASE (round-4 review, finding 1). A member whose sync.remote
 * was positively ABSENT when first read never reaches the skip path -- both
 * pre-gates take the no-remote exit first -- so the lazy re-check above
 * cannot cover it, and a first cut of this design accepted that as
 * residual. It is not acceptable: an agent that wires a remote mid-dispatch
 * (a `bd init --remote` / `bd config set sync.remote` in its own session)
 * would leave every later D-push of that member reporting `{ ok: true,
 * skipped: true, reason: 'no-remote' }` -- success -- while its bead closes
 * never left the clone, for the rest of the process. So a memoized ABSENT
 * answer is re-read once after any dispatch to the member, at the next
 * pre-gate (readMemberSyncRemote). Cost: one config.yaml read per dispatch,
 * paid ONLY by members with no remote (sandboxes, the no-remote mock
 * sprint -- whose golden transcript therefore shows one probe per dispatch);
 * a member with a remote still pays one probe per process.

// instant re-issue -- the previous code retried with zero delay, which turned
// the bound into "fail twice as fast". Delay is attempt-indexed and capped, and
// `sleep` is injectable so unit suites never actually wait.
//
// apra-fleet-ka1u follow-up: a live Windows machine-wide git.exe spawn outage
// (fork/exec ... "Not enough memory resources") was directly measured to last
// 1-3 MINUTES per occurrence (fleet supervisor log analysis), during which
// essentially every dolt-initiated git spawn fails -- not an isolated blip.
// The original 8s cap meant even 5 retries covered at most ~15s of backoff,
// structurally unable to span an outage an order of magnitude longer; the
// sprint kept dying with retries correctly firing but exhausted. Raised to
// 30s so a realistic retry budget can actually outlast one of these windows
// instead of just softening it.
//
// TIME-BOXED, NOT COUNT-BOXED (dolt sync budget review, section A.3)
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Widening the ladder to `maxTransientRetries = 8` with a 30s cap fixed the
// spawn-outage case but applied that budget to EVERY transient kind, and the
// cost was demonstrated immediately: the unit suite went from 80s to 6m15s,
// because an ordinary transient in a test fixture now walked the full 8-retry
// x 30s-cap ladder (91.5s of pure sleep in one exhausted ladder, before
// counting the 600s per-attempt timeout). The retry budget was never really
// about a COUNT -- it was about spanning a wall-clock outage window.
//
// So the ladder is split by error CLASS, and only the class that motivated the
// widening gets the long budget:
//
//   * SPAWN OUTAGE (`fork/exec ...`, "Not enough memory resources") -- the OS
//     refused to start git.exe at all. Retried against a WALL-CLOCK budget
//     (DOLT_SPAWN_OUTAGE_BUDGET_MS, 3 min, matching the measured 1-3 min
//     window) with the 30s backoff cap. The bound is elapsed time, so it is
//     the same 3 minutes whether each attempt returns instantly or sits on a
//     long timeout -- the old count-based bound multiplied out to a worst case
//     of 9 attempts x the 600s step timeout.
//   * EVERY OTHER TRANSIENT (network blip, busy server, held row lock) keeps
//     the short ladder it always had before the widening: 5 retries, 8s cap.
//     These were never the failure the long budget was bought for, and giving
//     them the long one is exactly what caused the suite regression.
//
// `maxTransientRetries` still bounds the generic class and is still honored
// when a caller passes it explicitly, so every existing test seam keeps
// working; only the DEFAULT drops back from 8 to the pre-widening 5.
//
// ROUND-3 CORRECTION (dolt sync budget review round 3, item 4): "honored when
// passed explicitly" now applies to BOTH classes. The round-2 cut let an
// explicit `maxTransientRetries` cap only the generic ladder while the
// spawn-outage ladder ignored it and always ran to its own wall-clock budget
// and 30-attempt backstop -- a caller asking for a tight bound could still sit
// in a 3-minute retry loop. An explicit value is now a hard attempt cap on the
// spawn-outage ladder too (min(explicit, DOLT_SPAWN_OUTAGE_MAX_RETRIES), with
// the wall-clock budget still applying on top). Left UNSPECIFIED -- the
// production default, since no runner call site passes it -- the spawn-outage
// class keeps the full wall-clock budget; the "hard attempt backstop" below is
// then the only count in play. runDoltStep() therefore distinguishes "not
// passed" (undefined) from "passed", which is why the bracket entry points no
// longer fill in the default themselves.
//
// ROUND-2 CORRECTION (dolt sync budget review round 2, item 3): the first cut
// of this split set the generic default to 2, describing it as "the ladder it
// always had before the widening". That was wrong -- `git show 3f49419b`
// (bump D-pull/D-push transient-retry budget from 1 to 5) shows the
// pre-widening default was 5 (~15.5s of backoff), not 2 (~1.5s). The suite
// regression that motivated the reduction came from the SPAWN-OUTAGE class's
// 3-minute wall-clock budget, a test-fixture problem (fixtures sleeping
// through real backoff), not from this ladder -- so the generic class is back
// at 5 and any slow test injects its own `sleep`/`backoffBaseMs` instead.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Remote-tip fingerprint: skip a D-pull only when the remote provably has not
// moved (dolt sync budget review, section B.1)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE CORRECTNESS ANCHOR. The shared remote's `refs/dolt/data` ref is the ONLY
// channel through which beads state moves between machines. A member's clone
// can therefore be stale in exactly one way: that ref advanced since the member
// last pulled or pushed. "Is a D-pull needed?" is then a question with a cheap,
// EXACT answer -- compare the remote SHA now against the SHA this member last
// synchronized to -- rather than a policy bet about who else might be writing.
// That is why this supersedes the role-based and time-based skip policies that
// were considered: those trade real staleness for speed (a reviewer reading
// acceptance criteria a remote doer just pushed is the exact false-FAILED-streak
// failure the post-streak verify pull exists to prevent), whereas a tip-equal
// skip removes only pulls that are provably no-ops.
//
// The probe is `git ls-remote <sync.remote> refs/dolt/data`: one network round
// trip, no Dolt engine startup, no 548MB chunk store to open (~0.35s measured,
// against multi-minute real pulls).
//
// THE RECORDED TIP is minted in exactly ONE place, and only ever from a value
// this member's clone is PROVABLY current with:
//   * after a successful PULL, record the SHA observed IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the
//     pull -- never one read afterwards. A push racing in during the pull then
//     simply forces the NEXT pull to be real, which is the safe error.
//   * after a successful PUSH by this member, FORGET the recorded tip. A push
//     never records anything -- see the block below for why.
//
// WHY A PUSH CANNOT MINT A FINGERPRINT (dolt sync budget review round 3,
// item 1 -- the correct redesign of two earlier attempts):
//
//   Attempt 1 recorded the remote SHA read AFTER the push, "still under the
//   push mutex". Attempt 2 read it before AND after, and recorded the post-push
//   SHA only when the ref had advanced ("it advanced, so I must have moved
//   it"). Both are wrong for the same reason: the push mutex serializes THIS
//   FLEET's pushes against each other and nothing else. Any unrelated machine
//   can push to the same shared remote in the gap between this member's push
//   completing and its post-push `git ls-remote` returning. The post-push read
//   then observes a stranger's newer commit that this clone has never seen,
//   records it as "my lastSyncedTip", and the very next D-pull is wrongly
//   skipped -- exactly the staleness this feature exists to prevent. A network
//   read of "the remote's current tip" is NEVER a proxy for "what my push
//   published".
//
//   The obvious local alternative -- record this clone's own commit SHA, the
//   thing a fast-forward push makes the remote ref equal to -- does not exist
//   for THIS transport. bd's git-backed remote (`git+https://...`) is Dolt's
//   git blobstore: a push wraps the chunk-store manifest in a FRESH git commit,
//   built inside the push on top of the remote head it just fetched, and
//   publishes it with a lease. That commit (and so the remote's new
//   refs/dolt/data SHA) is minted by the push itself, is not a function of
//   local Dolt state, is not printed by `bd dolt push` ("Pushing to Dolt
//   remote... / Push complete." either way), and lands locally only in a
//   per-process UUID-named ref (refs/dolt/blobstore/<remote>/dolt/data/<uuid>)
//   inside a sha256-named cache dir under .beads/ -- reachable only by a
//   shell-dialect-specific filesystem scan on the member, which is exactly the
//   kind of doubt this module refuses to turn into a skip. (Verified against a
//   live clone: the cache repo's tracking refs and FETCH_HEAD already disagreed
//   with the remote's live tip, and no stable local ref names the pushed SHA.)
//
//   So a successful push FORGETS the fingerprint. The remote is now at a SHA
//   this module cannot know; the pusher's next D-pull runs one real pull (after
//   one ls-remote that re-arms the skip for the pulls after it). That is the
//   conservative direction by construction: a redundant pull is the safe

 *
 * NOTE: this deliberately derives the probe target from sync.remote and NEVER

 * every provisioned member carries a git credential helper for its VCS host
 * (provision_vcs_auth writes it; that is how `git push` works on members
 * today), and a member whose ONLY credential was the embedded userinfo gets
 * a failed probe, which is the fail-open real pull, not a wrong skip. ssh

/**
 * D-push: publish `member`'s committed beads changes to the shared remote
 * after a beads-mutating step -- `bd dolt push` with a mechanical,
 * first-successful-pusher-wins reconcile. If the push is rejected because the
 * remote moved first, do EXACTLY ONE `bd dolt pull` (reconciling ours/theirs
 * by which clone resolves -- never per-conflict judgment) and re-push once; if
 * that is still rejected, raise a typed DoltDivergedError. Transient (network
 * / server / lock) failures are retried up to `maxTransientRetries`; a
 * divergence is never retried beyond the one bounded reconcile.
 *
 * `pushBeads: false` makes this a no-op (a read-only bracket has nothing to
 * publish). Every command is issued via the injected command() with an
 * explicit member_name.
 *
 * The actual push is serialized behind a GLOBAL push mutex because two
 * concurrent dolt pushes can produce row-level conflicts, and a single
 * unresolved conflict wedges an entire clone's sync. `opts.mutex` is a client
 * with acquire()/release(); it is acquired before the first push attempt and
 * released in a `finally` on EVERY terminal path -- success, transient
 * exhaustion, and divergence -- so a failed push can never leak it. A crashed
 * holder is reclaimed by the mutex's own lease expiry, not by this bracket.
 *
 * Two paths return the benign `{ ok: true, pushed: false, reconciled: false,
 * skipped: true, reason: 'no-remote' }` instead of throwing: a 'no-remote'
 * classification, and -- defense in depth -- any non-diverged failure
 * classifyDoltFailure cannot recognize as 'no-remote' from stderr alone (e.g.
 * a credentials error from a mis-wired Dolt-level remote) when `member`'s
 * bd-level sync.remote is itself absent/neutralized, since nothing is
 * supposed to leave such a clone. A clone with an actively configured
 * sync.remote still throws DoltSyncError on that failure. Override the check
 * with `opts.checkSyncRemoteConfigured` (same `(member, {command, log}) =>
 * Promise<boolean>` shape) in tests.
 *
 * `onAuthFailure` is threaded through to every runDoltStep call below
 * (including the reconcile/re-push) -- see runDoltStep's AUTH SELF-HEAL
 * CONTRACT.
 *
 * REMOTE-TIP FINGERPRINT: a successful push (first attempt or the re-push
 * after the one reconcile) FORGETS this member's recorded tip and issues no
 * `git ls-remote` at all -- see "WHY A PUSH CANNOT MINT A FINGERPRINT" above
 * doltPullBefore. The pusher's next D-pull is therefore always real.
 *
 * `opts.settle` is the optional deterministic conflict-settlement callback
 * (buildSettleCallback, dolt-settle.mjs). When present, a divergence that
 * outlives the bounded reconcile runs settle before the DoltDivergedError is
 * surfaced as BEADS_SYNC_CONFLICT; when absent the divergence propagates
 * immediately (pre-settle behavior).

// PRODUCT DECISION (417.3, do not relitigate): concurrent multi-agent dolt
// push/pull is a NORMAL condition, and a beads-sync hiccup must never
// hard-abort an otherwise healthy sprint. The primitives above still THROW --
// that is what the fatal call sites and the existing DoltDivergedError /
// DoltSyncError consumers (terminal-reason resolution, conflict-dump capture,
// PostDispatchSyncError wrapping) rely on. What changes here is the DEFAULT at
// the purpose-based entry points: syncBefore()/syncAfter() answer with a
// STRUCTURED OUTCOME instead of throwing, and a hard abort is now something a
// call site asks for EXPLICITLY (`fatal: true`), not what it gets by accident.
//
// Outcome shape (a superset of the primitives' old return objects, so every
// existing consumer of `.skipped` / `.reason` / `.pushed` / `.reconciled`
// keeps working unchanged):
//
//   { ok, kind, degraded, detail, member, operation, error?, ...legacy fields }
//
//   ok        -- did the sync do what it was asked to do (a benign skip is ok)
//   kind      -- 'synced' | 'no-remote' | 'empty-remote' | 'already-fresh'
//                | 'remote-unchanged' | 'diverged' | 'auth' | 'transient'
//                | 'remote-unreachable' | 'unknown'
//   degraded  -- true when the sync FAILED and the sprint is continuing anyway
//   detail    -- one human-readable line (the underlying error's message)
//   error     -- the underlying typed error, retained for later escalation
//
// VISIBILITY: a degraded outcome is never silent. It is logged loudly, passed
// to the optional `onDegraded` hook (the seam a caller uses to file a flagged
// follow-up bead), and appended to a module-level record list that
// getDegradedSyncRecords() exposes so a sprint can report "these syncs did not
// land". A record for `member` is retired when a later syncAfter() for the same
