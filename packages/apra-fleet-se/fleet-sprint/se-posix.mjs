// se-posix.mjs -- POSIX (linux/darwin) member-bound command primitives for
// fleet-sprint and the supervisor.
//
// This is fleet-sprint's OWN shell layer, deliberately NOT shared with
// apra-fleet core's src/os/*.ts: core ships as a compiled binary while these
// files ship as open, user-copyable source, and fleet-sprint is meant to stay
// apra-fleet-agnostic. The `se-` filename prefix keeps them from being
// confused with the core-side modules. Nothing here imports apra-fleet core,
// and nothing here needs a build step -- plain ESM that Node runs as-is.
//
// SCOPE OF THE PRIMITIVE SET: every method below exists because a real
// member-bound call site in this package builds that string today. See
// se-os-commands.mjs's header for the call-site inventory. Primitives are
// added when a call site needs one, never speculatively.
//
// HOUSE RULE THIS LAYER ENFORCES: a member-bound command string must not rely
// on the ORCHESTRATOR's shell or filesystem -- paths are resolved in
// JavaScript, and the only shell-level expansion that survives is the member's
// own home-directory token ($HOME here, $env:USERPROFILE on the PowerShell
// side). That single exception is deliberate and load-bearing: the credential
// helper file was WRITTEN by apra-fleet core using exactly that token, so the
// read must resolve the home directory the same way the write did rather than
// through an independently probed path.
