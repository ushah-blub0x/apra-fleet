/**
 * apra-fleet-e28 / KB trust pipeline Phase 2: KB priming for the fleet-sprint
 * engine, which had none -- it lived only in the Claude workflow copy.
 *
 * `callTool` is injected exactly like `createMemberReservationClient`'s, so this
 * stays transport-agnostic and unit-testable without a live fleet server.
 *
 * WHY PER MEMBER, NOT PER SPRINT: this engine has no repo path of its own. It
 * coordinates members by name and branch; the repo lives on each member's side,
 * possibly on a different host at a different path. `kb_session_prime` selects
 * WHICH project KB is read from its `repo_path`, and omitting that argument
 * falls back to the fleet server's own cwd -- collapsing every member's
 * knowledge into whichever repo the server happens to sit in, which is exactly
 * the apra-fleet-tm7 / apra-fleet-3zl repo-blindness defect. So the work folder
 * is resolved per member via `member_detail` (which reports it as `folder`) and
 * each member is primed against its own repo.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout, matching the reservation client's precedent: a member
 * whose folder cannot be resolved, or whose prime call fails, is logged and
 * skipped. A sprint must not fail because the KB is cold -- priming is an
 * optimisation, and every role contract's Step 0 already degrades gracefully
 * when the KB tools are unavailable.

 * over as prompt content. Step 0 stays correct for the OTHER execution path
 * (an apra-pm orchestrator session running these contracts as local subagents,
 * where the MCP server is present), so both paths now get knowledge.
 *
 * Only CONFIRMED, undisputed entries are rendered (isInjectableKbEntry) --
 * every caller's source is already filtered, and this is the last chokepoint
