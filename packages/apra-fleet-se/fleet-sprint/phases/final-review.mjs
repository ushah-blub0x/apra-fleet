// =============================================================================
// PHASE MODULE: Final Review (apra-fleet-3swo.6.6).
//
// The NINTH of runSprintCycle's twelve phase() boundaries -- the sprint's
// closing, evidence-based verdict. It D-pulls the orchestrator's beads clone so
// the closing counts reflect every member's pushed state, dispatches the
// REVIEWER persona over the whole sprint, and then has the ORCHESTRATOR -- never
// the LLM -- apply every structured transition that verdict asks for (validated
// newTask creation, guarded reopens) before D-pushing the beads it just mutated.
// Moved verbatim out of runner.js: every prompt, log line, dispatch option,
// validation branch and sync call is byte-identical to the inline version, so
// the golden transcript is unchanged. Move-only, no behaviour change.
//
// WHERE THIS PHASE STARTS AND STOPS. It runs from its own phase() call to the
// findings D-push that closes it. The `group('Finalization')` banner above the
// call site stays in runner.js -- it wraps Finalization as a WHOLE (this phase,
// Regression Test, Harvest and Publish PR), not this phase alone -- and
// everything after the findings D-push belongs to the phases that follow.
//
// WHAT COMES BACK, AND WHY IT MATTERS THAT IT DOES. `finalVerdictResult` IS the
// sprint's outcome: Publish PR reads its verdict and notes, and the analysis doc
// the harvester writes renders it alongside `finalClosedCount` /
// `finalOpenAtGoalCount`. Those three are the phase's return value rather than
// closure writes. The ORDER this creates is load-bearing and is not merely
// cosmetic: the once-per-sprint Regression Test phase runs AFTER this one
// precisely so `finalVerdictResult` is already computed by the time it runs, so
// a regression failure structurally CANNOT perturb the sprint verdict. See the
// "6b. Regression Test" banner at its call site in runner.js for the full
// statement of that guarantee, and ./regression-test.mjs's header for the other
// half of it. `rejectedNewTasks` and `deployFailures`/`integFailures` are arrays
// this phase pushes to or reads, so passing the arrays themselves is exactly
// equivalent to the closure they replace.
//
// THE FINDINGS PUSH MUST STAY BRACKETED. The D-push at the end of this phase
// used to be a BARE doltPushAfter() outside every bracket, so the clean-state
// pause guard reported "safe to pause" while the Final Review findings were
// mid-push (apra-fleet-3swo.4.1). It moved here as gitSync.pushBeadsAfter(),
// the bracketed entry point, and must stay that way -- there is no unbracketed
// way to reach doltPushAfter() from this module, and unbracketed-push-guard.mjs
// enforces that now this file is registered in ../guarded-modules.mjs.
//
// THE GUARDED VERDICT PATH IS NOT OPTIONAL. This is one of the three verdict
// sites that apply reopens, and all three go through the SHARED
// applyGuardedReopens() helper in ../beads-transitions.mjs so a below-goal
// bead named by a reviewer is never pulled back into a scope this sprint no
// longer targets. That import moved here INTACT: this module must never grow a
// private reopen loop or a private allowlist of its own (pinned by
// test/beads-transitions-extraction.test.mjs, which scans phases/review.mjs,
// phases/re-review.mjs and this file as separate sources and asserts which one
// owns which of the three sites -- runner.js itself now owns none).
//
// WHY SOME HELPERS ARE INJECTED RATHER THAN IMPORTED. dispatchCtx, gitSync,
// bdListScoped, decomposedParentIds, goalMax, kbPriming, kbWork,
// getMemberForRole, childIdAllocator, sprintMutexId and args are
// runSprintCycle-scoped locals, and NOT_DONE_STATUSES and resolveSettleShell
// are runner-module-private, so there is nothing to import. computeChildFloor,
// createChildBeadWithAllocatedId and sanitizePrText are exported BY runner.js;
// importing them here would make phases/final-review.mjs <-> runner.js a
// circular pair for the sake of three helpers, so they come through the state
// argument instead -- the same rule ./review.mjs's and ./re-review.mjs's
// headers state. The dependencies that live in real sibling modules
// (dispatchRole/TURN_BASES, buildFinalVerdictPrompt, applyGuardedReopens/
// parseIdWithReasonEntry, the abort.mjs newTask helpers, buildSettleCallback)
// are imported directly.
//
// GUARD COVERAGE: registered as 'phases/final-review.mjs' in
// ../guarded-modules.mjs. It took NO member_name-bearing command() call site
// out of runner.js -- its bead reads go through the injected bdListScoped and
// its writes through applyGuardedReopens and computeChildFloor/
// createChildBeadWithAllocatedId, whose command() sites live in the modules
// that already own them -- but it took ONE dispatchRole() site (the
// final-review ladder), which is exactly what dispatch-safety-guard and the
// phase 3 dispatch census read. It also owns a real gitSync bracket at each
// end. Both the zero command() baseline and the one dispatch site are pinned
// rather than assumed, so a future edit that reaches for a raw command() here
// turns red instead of landing on an unguarded site.
