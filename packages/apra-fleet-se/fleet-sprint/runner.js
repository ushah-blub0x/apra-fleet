//   reviewer           -> 'premium'  (both per-round AND final review; vendor contract: "always use model: premium")

 * Resolve a member's registered shell for a buildSettleCallback call site,

 * pre-dispatch wiring at runSprintCycle's dispatch bracket is (apra-
 * fleet-7dir.16) -- so a mock-sprint scenario with no MCP client wired keeps
 * its pre-shell-aware default ('', PowerShell dialect on Windows) instead of
 * throwing or hanging on a fleetApi call that has nothing to answer it.
 * Shared by every remaining buildSettleCallback call site so each one does
 * not have to re-implement the guard (apra-fleet-7dir.24).
 *
 * apra-fleet-3swo.6.1: this no longer builds a fleet client of its own. It
 * used to run `new ApraFleet({ callTool: args.callTool })` on EVERY call, at
 * seven call sites, several of them per dispatch. The client is now
 * sprint-scoped state (fleet-sprint/sprint-state.mjs), resolved once per
 * sprint:
 *   1. `sprintState` -- the object runSprintCycle creates once at sprint start
 *      and threads down. Every in-cycle call site passes it.
 *   2. `args.callTool` alone -- the fallback for the call sites reached from
 *      OUTSIDE runSprintCycle's closure (syncMemberAfterOrdered, called by
 *      git-sync.mjs's withGitSync teardown, which is handed `args` and no
 *      sprint state). sprintScopedFleetApi memoizes per callTool identity, so
 *      this path shares the sprint's single client rather than building one
 *      per call.
 *   3. neither -- the empty string, the pre-shell-aware default (see above).
 *
 * The resolved { os, shell } itself is deliberately NOT memoized here or in
 * sprint state: member-target.mjs owns that cache and does not cache its
 * degrade, so a transiently-unreachable member is re-resolved next call

// Builds a self-contained planner prompt per the vendored

// conversation, so every fact it needs (which sprint root issue(s) are in
// scope, the goal priority, the requirements file content, and -- for a
// re-planning cycle -- explicit "gaps only" framing) must be spelled out in
// the prompt text rather than assumed.
//
// Model-tier convention: planner.md Step 3 is the authoritative source and
// makes beads *metadata* set at creation time (`bd create ... --metadata
// '{"model": "<tier>"}'`) the ONLY location the model tier is recorded --
// never `--notes` or a METADATA-section comment. Every consumer (the
// plan-reviewer, and the orchestrator that dispatches doers) reads it back
// from that same field, so this prompt's instruction MUST stay aligned with
// planner.md Step 3.
// classifyVerifySet lives in beads-scope.mjs (apra-fleet-3swo.4.6) so it and

// above.

// registry driving "round resume" across a cycle's approval loop; both are
// re-exported from this file above.

 * Builds the self-contained reviewer dispatch prompt. The reviewer is
 * dispatched without resume and so has no memory of this run: the exact bead
 * ids just worked, their full `bd show` detail (acceptance criteria), the diff
 * range, and the sprint goal priority are all spelled out rather than assumed.
 *
 * CRITICAL: explicitly, redundantly forbids the reviewer from mutating
 * beads itself. agents/reviewer.md's own prose (Step 5, Rules) already
 * states this same prohibition -- prose and dispatch prompt agree today --
 * but the schema alone doesn't stop the reviewer from shelling out `bd`
 * commands on the member side regardless of what either document says, so
 * the prohibition is stated here too as defense in depth, not because of
 * any known prose/code divergence.
 * apra-fleet-s6d: `beadIds` may legitimately be EMPTY. The Cycle Evaluation
 * re-review asks a scope-wide question ("no goal-priority beads are open --
 * is the sprint actually done?"), so it has no bead ids to name. Rendering
 * the per-bead framing anyway produced the literal dangling sentence
 * "...for the following bead id(s): ." plus a SPRINT SCOPE block ordering the
 * reviewer to judge "ONLY against the named bead id(s) above" -- against an
 * empty set. The reviewer answered honestly (CHANGES_NEEDED with nothing to
 * reopen and nothing to create), which is exactly what
 * isReviewerContractViolation flags; the retry re-sent the identical
 * incoherent prompt, so the sprint aborted on ReviewerContractViolationError.
 * The empty case therefore gets its own coherent scope-wide framing.
