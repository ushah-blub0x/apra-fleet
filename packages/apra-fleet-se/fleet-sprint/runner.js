 * Shared by every remaining buildSettleCallback call site so each one does
 * not have to re-implement the guard (apra-fleet-7dir.24).
 *
 * apra-fleet-3swo.6.1: this no longer builds a fleet client of its own. It
 * used to run `new ApraFleet({ callTool: args.callTool })` on EVERY call, at
 * seven call sites, several of them per dispatch. The client is now
 * sprint-scoped state (fleet-sprint/sprint-state.mjs), resolved once per
 * sprint:
 *   1. `sprintState` -- the object runSprintCycle creates once at sprint start
 *      and threads down. Every in-cycle call site passes it.
 *   2. `args.callTool` alone -- the fallback for the call sites reached from
 *      OUTSIDE runSprintCycle's closure (syncMemberAfterOrdered, called by
 *      git-sync.mjs's withGitSync teardown, which is handed `args` and no
 *      sprint state). sprintScopedFleetApi memoizes per callTool identity, so
 *      this path shares the sprint's single client rather than building one
 *      per call.
 *   3. neither -- the empty string, the pre-shell-aware default (see above).
 *
 * The resolved { os, shell } itself is deliberately NOT memoized here or in
 * sprint state: member-target.mjs owns that cache and does not cache its
 * degrade, so a transiently-unreachable member is re-resolved next call
 * (apra-fleet-ot2z.13). See sprint-state.mjs's header.

 *
 * CRITICAL: explicitly, redundantly forbids the reviewer from mutating

 * states this same prohibition -- prose and dispatch prompt agree today --

 * is the sprint actually done?"), so it has no bead ids to name. Rendering
 * the per-bead framing anyway produced the literal dangling sentence
 * "...for the following bead id(s): ." plus a SPRINT SCOPE block ordering the
 * reviewer to judge "ONLY against the named bead id(s) above" -- against an
 * empty set. The reviewer answered honestly (CHANGES_NEEDED with nothing to

 * incoherent prompt, so the sprint aborted on ReviewerContractViolationError.
