# Running fleet-sprint

`fleet-sprint` is this package's autonomous sprint engine. It drives a full
plan -> develop -> review -> deploy -> integ-test -> harvest cycle across one
or more registered fleet members, working a set of beads issues on a branch
and opening a PR at the end.

This doc covers the two ways to invoke it, the full argument contract, the
preconditions to check first, and the beads hierarchy rules that determine
what a sprint actually picks up as its scope.

## Two ways to invoke it

Both forms run the exact same engine
(`packages/apra-fleet-se/fleet-sprint/runner.js`) with the same flags. They
differ only in how the entry point is resolved.

### 1. Installed binary (normal use)

```bash
apra-fleet workflow fleet-sprint \
  --issue apra-fleet-eft \
  --members fleet-rev \
  --branch sprint/eft-service-fixes \
  --base main \
  --viewer-port 18300
```

This is the ONE command for every install method -- git-clone dev checkout,
`npm install -g @apralabs/apra-fleet`, and the pre-built standalone binary
all resolve it identically; there is no separate npm-only invocation to
learn. The launcher resolves the workflow from
`~/.apra-fleet/workflows/fleet-sprint` (installed by `apra-fleet install`,
self-healed on demand). Everything after the workflow name is passed
through verbatim, so `apra-fleet workflow fleet-sprint --help` prints the
engine's own help.

### 2. Directly from a source checkout (development only)

```bash
node packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/cli.mjs \
  --issue apra-fleet-eft \
  --members fleet-rev \
  --branch sprint/eft-service-fixes \
  --base main \
  --viewer-port 18300
```

A development-only shortcut for when you are actively changing the engine
itself and want to run the working tree directly rather than the installed
copy. Not needed, and not documented as a supported path, for any other use
-- use mode 1 above.

### Backgrounding

A sprint is a long-running process. Start it genuinely detached, not as a
child of a short-lived tool call whose process group can be killed out from
under it:

```bash
# POSIX
nohup apra-fleet workflow fleet-sprint --issue <id> --members <m> \
  --branch <branch> --base <base> > sprint.log 2>&1 &
disown
```

```powershell
# Windows
Start-Process -FilePath "apra-fleet" -ArgumentList "workflow","fleet-sprint", `
  "--issue","<id>","--members","<m>","--branch","<branch>","--base","<base>" `
  -RedirectStandardOutput "sprint.log" -RedirectStandardError "sprint.err.log" `
  -WindowStyle Hidden -PassThru
```

On start it prints the dashboard URL (`http://localhost:<viewer-port>`).
Watch progress there rather than tailing raw stdout.

## Arguments

| Flag | Short | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--issue <ids>` | `-i` | yes | -- | Target issue ID(s), comma separated (e.g. `epic-1,epic-2`). Scope resolves to each id's full descendant subtree -- see the epics section below. |
| `--members <ids>` | `-m` | yes | -- | Member IDs/names to use, comma separated. Members act as repo targets for parallelism. |
| `--branch <name>` | `-b` | yes | -- | Sprint branch to develop on. Created from `--base` if it does not exist; reused as-is if it does. |
| `--base <name>` | `-B` | yes | -- | Base branch the sprint branch is created from, and the branch the eventual PR targets. |
| `--goal <goal>` | `-g` | no | `P1/P2` | Sprint goal constraint. One of `P1`, `P1/P2`, `P1/P2/P3`. |
| `--max-cycles <n>` | `-c` | no | `5` | Max plan/develop/review cycles. |
| `--allow-missing-members` | | no | off | Warn and continue if some `--members` are not registered with the fleet. Without it, any missing member aborts the sprint. |
| `--requirements-file <path>` | | no | -- | Path to a requirements file threaded into the planner's prompt. |
| `--role-map <json\|@file>` | | no | -- | JSON object mapping role -> member[], e.g. `'{"doer":["m1","m2"]}'`. Inline JSON or `@path/to/file.json`. |
| `--viewer-port <port>` | | no | `8080` | Port for the local dashboard viewer. |
| `--budget <usd>` | | no | unlimited | USD ceiling for this run's total estimated spend. |
| `--dispatch-timeout-s <s>` | | no | `9000` | Per-dispatch time budget in seconds, applied as both the inactivity timeout and the hard ceiling on every agent dispatch (integ-test dispatch ceiling is 2x, regression-test ceiling is 3x). Minimum 60. Lower it for small sprints so a hung dispatch costs minutes, not 2.5 hours. |
| `--sync` | | no | off | Synced topology mode (orchestrator-bracketed git sync): members may sit on differing HEADs but must share the same origin URL and pass a `bd dolt pull` probe. Omitted uses shared-workspace mode (all members on the same HEAD). |
| `--help` | `-h` | | | Show the engine's help. |

Unrecognized flags fail loudly rather than being silently ignored, so a typo
like `--max-cycle` aborts instead of quietly applying the default.

**A shared/`unreservable` orchestrator member goes in `--role-map` ONLY, never
in `--members`.** `--members` (and `--role-map` values for git-having roles
like doer/reviewer/harvester) still get git-identity/topology-checked and, on
resume, git-resynced. A member registered `unreservable: true` (e.g. a
beads-only orchestrator shared across concurrent sprints) is exempted from
those checks only when it appears exclusively via `roleMap.orchestrator` --
listing it in `--members` too is redundant and not required, and defeats the
exemption for anything outside the topology precondition (e.g. a paused/
resumed sprint's resync step still runs real git commands against every
`--members` entry, unreservable or not).

## Preconditions worth checking first

- The target issue (e.g. `apra-fleet-7pm`) must exist and be open:
  `bd show <issue>`.
- Every `--members` name must be registered with the fleet
  (`list_members`); an unregistered member aborts the sprint unless
  `--allow-missing-members` is passed.
- Multi-member sprints require all configured members to share the same
  git HEAD (`checkMemberTopology`) unless `--sync` is passed -- see
  `fleet-sprint-diagram.md` for the supported-topology notes. Stick to
  single-member unless that is verified.
- If a member's LLM session is stale or unauthenticated (dispatch fails with
  `empty_response`, or "member CLI likely died"), re-run `provision_llm_auth`
  for that member before retrying.

## How to make one bead represent a whole set (epics / manifest beads)

If you want a single bead to stand in for a group of other beads (an epic,
a "next sprint scope" manifest, etc.), the group members MUST be linked as
**parent-child**, not as **blocked-by**:

- Add each item as a child of the umbrella bead:
  `bd create ... --parent <umbrella-id>` (new beads), or
  `bd update <id> --parent <umbrella-id>` (existing beads).
- The umbrella bead itself must have **zero** blocking dependencies of its
  own -- do not also add `blocks` edges from the umbrella bead to its own
  children. It should only ever be the *target* of parent-child edges
  (children point at it), never the source of a `blocks` edge pointing at
  them.
- "All done" tracking (closing the umbrella bead once every child is
  closed) is a manual/observational step based on child status
  (`dependent_count`), not something enforced by a `blocks` edge.

Why this matters: `bd`'s ready-work engine treats a `blocks` edge as a real
blocker. If the umbrella bead both (a) is `blocked-by` its children (so it
can't close until they do) AND (b) is their `parent` (so they belong to it),
that is a 2-node cycle on every pair -- and `bd` marks every bead caught in
a cycle as **not ready**, deadlocking the umbrella bead and all of its
children simultaneously. This is exactly what "blocked-by" gets you wrong
and "parent-child" gets right: a successful epic (e.g. `apra-fleet-7pm`)
has `dependency_count: 0` (it depends on / is blocked by nothing) and a
nonzero `dependent_count` (its children point at it). A broken manifest
bead that used `blocks` instead had `dependency_count: 5` and, once
children were also parented under it, deadlocked completely.

This also matters for launching a sprint: `fleet-sprint`'s `--issue <id>`
flag resolves the sprint's scope by walking the `parent-child` tree down from
`<id>` -- `bdListScoped()` fetches the whole project's beads once and does
the descendant walk in memory, so every descendant at any depth is in scope
(not just direct children), but nothing outside the parent-child hierarchy
ever is. A `blocked-by`-only manifest bead is invisible to fleet-sprint's
scope filter no matter what you pass to `--issue`; only true children are
picked up. See `packages/apra-fleet-se/docs/fleet-sprint-cli-contract.md` for
the full algorithm and worked examples.

## Recovering a wedged member reservation (launched via the supervisor)

If a sprint was launched through the supervisor (`bin/serve.mjs`, installed
as `fleet-se-serve`; `POST /api/sprints`) and its child process crashes or is killed, the supervisor's
reservation ledger does **not** release that sprint's claim on its own during
normal runtime -- only a supervisor restart, or an explicit operator call,
clears it. Symptom: relaunching against the same member(s) is rejected with

```
409 member overlap rejects launch: sprint '<old-sprint-id>' already claims [<member>]
```

and `POST /api/sprints/:id/stop` against that same old sprint id also fails
(`409 ... no reachable child (port unknown)`) because the child is already
dead -- there is nothing left to proxy a stop to.

Clear it directly, with no supervisor restart required:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/reservations/<old-sprint-id>/force-release \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"by": "<your name/reason>", "reason": "sprint child crashed, pid confirmed dead"}'
```

This releases both of the supervisor ledger's axes (member set + issue-scope
root) for that sprint id in one call and records an auditable
`force-released` event in the supervisor's event history. It does **not**
restart anything and does not affect any other live sprint.

This is a *different* mechanism from the fleet server's own per-member
`reservedBy` field (enforced at dispatch time, independent of the
supervisor). If a relaunch still 409s after force-releasing the ledger side,
also clear that axis:

```
mcp__apra-fleet__member_reservation  action: "force_release"  member_name: "<member>"
```

A crashed sprint can leave either axis wedged independently of the other --
check both. See `packages/apra-fleet-se/docs/architecture.md` ("Supervisor:
process model" / "Manual force-release") for the full mechanism.
