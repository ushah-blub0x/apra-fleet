/**
 * AzureDevOpsVCS -- the Azure DevOps provider entry (apra-fleet-647.1.5.1).
 *
 * Registered so Azure DevOps is a first-class member of the SAME registry
 * that drives classifyFailure(), resolveProvider() and buildVcsCommand() --
 * before this file existed, 'azure-devops' was only a name-keyed entry in
 * vcs-module.mjs's now-deleted BUILDERS/DEFAULT_AUTH_MODES tables, which a
 * new provider had to also edit.
 *
 * No auth-mode axis of its own (a single PAT token field at
 * provision_vcs_auth time, same as Bitbucket -- see ./bitbucket.mjs).
 * apra-fleet-lzfv.2 adds the REST create-pull-request/comment builders (see
 * buildAzureDevOpsCreatePrCommand/buildAzureDevOpsCommentCommand below);
 * capabilitiesForHost()'s canOpenPullRequest is now true (apra-fleet-lzfv.5),
 * once runner.js's publish path could actually dispatch them (see that
 * function's doc comment). Any action WITHOUT a builder still fails closed
 * with a clear ASCII
 * "ERROR: ... does not yet implement action ..." from buildVcsCommand()
 * instead of a silently wrong command. Declaring `defaultAuthMode` (even as
 * `null`) is what makes 'azure-devops' part of resolveProvider()'s known
 * vocabulary -- see ./index.mjs's isAuthBackend().
 *
 * Extends GenericGitVCS for stderr classification. Azure DevOps' own
 * TF-numbered error codes (e.g. TF401019) previously were NOT added as a
 * dedicated pattern here, on the reasoning that the realistic full stderr for
 * an expired/invalid Azure DevOps credential over git-over-HTTPS still
 * carries git's own generic "fatal: Authentication failed for '<url>'" tail
 * line, which GenericGitVCS already classifies AUTH_EXPIRED (see
 * test/vcs-nongithub-auth-selfheal.test.mjs, apra-fleet-647.1.3.4).
 *
 * apra-fleet-417.6 (BLOCKS apra-fleet-647.1.3.4's own AC that no non-GitHub
 * provider signal is recognized without that tail): a bare 'remote:
 * TF401019: ...' line -- e.g. a REST/API path, or any transport that does not
 * append git's own tail -- reached classifyFailure() as UNKNOWN before this
 * pattern existed. TF401019's own text ("does not exist, or you do not have
 * permission to perform this operation") is Azure DevOps' deliberately
 * ambiguous repo-not-found-or-no-access message; re-minting the identical PAT
 * cannot fix either case (a missing repo needs creating, a real permission
 * gap needs granting), so this is AUTH_DENIED, not AUTH_EXPIRED -- consistent
 * with vcs-classify-failure.test.mjs's own AC1 example provider, which models
 * TF401019 the same way.
 *
 * apra-fleet-5co8.1.1 adds the host/URL axis: matchesHost(),
 * capabilitiesForHost() and parseRepoRef(). All three are descriptor hooks
 * dispatched from shared code (./index.mjs's resolveVcsProviderForHost(),
 * vcs-module.mjs's capabilities()), so no Azure DevOps conditional leaks into
 * a shared file. capabilitiesForHost() now reports canOpenPullRequest:true
 * (apra-fleet-lzfv.5) -- runner.js's publish path (raiseVcsPrForMember) is
 * provider-aware now, resolving the member's own registered provider instead
 * of hardcoding 'github', so this host can actually reach `builders` above.
 *
 * apra-fleet-5co8.4.1 adds two more additive rules on top of the bare
 * TF401019 AUTH_DENIED rule above (which stays exactly as-is): a REST 401 /
 * TF400813 both mean the PAT itself is expired or revoked (AUTH_EXPIRED --
 * re-minting the token is the fix), while a REST 403 is a missing-scope
 * refusal (AUTH_DENIED -- widening the PAT's scopes is the fix, per
 * skills/fleet/auth-azdevops.md's role/scope table). See the AUTH_EXPIRED /
 * AUTH_DENIED doc comments below for the exact texts and why each is
 * additive only, with no verdict moved for the pre-existing TF401019 case.
 *
 * apra-fleet-5co8.4.2 declares `authRemedy` (see its own doc comment below):
 * an auth-classified failure here can never be fixed by the shared reactive
 * self-heal alone, because a PAT is stored/redeployed, never re-minted --
 * runner.js prints this provider's remedy text via that generic descriptor
 * field rather than a provider-name conditional of its own.
 *
 * ASCII only.

 *      to end-of-string/line so an inline "401" mentioned mid-sentence (which
 *      says nothing about THIS call's own outcome) is never matched.
 *      azure-devops.mjs's own REST builders (added apra-fleet-lzfv.2, below)
 *      append it too, and classifyFailure() is reachable standalone (see
 *      vcs-classify-failure.test.mjs AC1/'providers listed as known but

 *      same REST API (skills/fleet/auth-azdevops.md's own `curl -sf` Test
 *      section) whose failure text this rule must classify correctly today.
 *    - TF400813, whose text is a generic "resource not available" refusal
 *      that Azure DevOps also emits for an expired/revoked PAT (the org-URL
 *      misconfiguration case in the troubleshooting table above resolves
 *      through the SAME message; re-minting -- which also forces a fresh

 * meaningless. Expressing that as a descriptor hook keeps the difference in

 *
 * SECRET TRANSPORT: the PAT is passed as a `{{secure.NAME}}` PLACEHOLDER, never
 * a value. Resolution happens hub-side inside the fleet server; the orchestrator
 * process that calls this hook never holds, logs or transports the plaintext,
 * and a remote member (which has no secret store of its own) never has to.

// token with admin consent the fleet does not hold (skills/fleet/
// auth-azdevops.md's "PAT Lifetime and Expiry" section). So when the
// REACTIVE self-heal (runner.js's createVcsAuthSelfHealCallback) fires on an
// auth-classified failure, calling provision_vcs_auth again just redeploys
// the SAME dead secret and is expected to fail again -- serverSideReMintable
// is false, and `hint` is the exact operator-facing remedy runner.js prints
// alongside the (still-attempted, still-logged) self-heal call, covering
// both AUTH_EXPIRED (401/TF400813 -- the PAT itself is dead) and AUTH_DENIED
// (403 -- the PAT is valid but scoped too narrowly; TF401019 is a
// repo/permission grant, not a scope, and has no PAT-rotation remedy) since
// the self-heal callback is never told which kind fired -- see
