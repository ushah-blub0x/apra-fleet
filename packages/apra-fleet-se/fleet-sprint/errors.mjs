// apra-fleet-unw.15 -- typed error(s) local to the auto-sprint runner.
//
// SprintPlanRejectedError is sprint-specific (it is only ever thrown by
// runner.js's Plan phase) so it lives here rather than in
// packages/apra-fleet-workflow/src/workflow/errors.mjs, which is the
// generic, package-wide error taxonomy for agent()/command() failures.
// It still extends WorkflowError so callers that only know about the
// generic taxonomy (e.g. a future top-level sprint-status classifier) can
// catch `WorkflowError` and still see this failure.

import { WorkflowError } from '@apralabs/apra-fleet-workflow';

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Neutral VCS failure taxonomy (apra-fleet-647.1.3.1)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The provider-agnostic vocabulary VCSModule.classifyFailure() emits, and the
// ONLY vocabulary downstream code is allowed to branch on. It deliberately
// contains no provider words: a caller decides what to do from `kind` alone,
// never by re-reading raw stderr and never by asking which provider produced
// it. Provider-specific detail (an Azure DevOps 'TF401019', a GitHub HTTP
// status) travels separately in `providerCode` as a DIAGNOSTIC, never as a
// control-flow input.
//
//   AUTH_EXPIRED          The presented credential is missing, stale or
//                         rejected as invalid. RE-PROVISIONING CAN FIX IT --
//                         this is the kind the one-shot provision_vcs_auth
//                         self-heal path exists for.
//   AUTH_DENIED           The identity was understood and refused: the
//                         principal lacks access. Re-minting the SAME
//                         credential cannot fix it; an operator must grant
//                         access.
//   DIVERGED              The remote moved / a non-fast-forward, unmerged or
//                         conflicted state. Never retried blindly -- under the
//                         single-writer stance this is proof the invariant is
//                         already broken.
//   TRANSIENT             A network / server / lock blip. The ONLY kind for
//                         which `retryable` is true.
//   NO_REMOTE             No remote is configured at all -- there is nothing
//                         to push or pull. Benign, not an error condition.
//   EMPTY_REMOTE           A remote IS configured but has never had anything
//                         pushed into it (apra-fleet-647.1.3.2, dolt provider
//                         only today -- Dolt's "no branches found in remote"
//                         Error 1105). Distinct from NO_REMOTE (nothing
//                         configured at all): benign, nothing to reconcile.
//   REMOTE_UNREACHABLE     A configured remote cannot be opened at all (a
//                         deleted directory behind a file:// remote, a dead
//                         path). Distinct from TRANSIENT: retrying cannot
//                         help, the target is gone, not busy.
//   UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION The requested action is not implemented for this
//                         provider. A programming/config error; retrying and
//                         re-authenticating are both pointless.
//   UNKNOWN               Explicitly unrecognized. Never retried, never
//                         self-healed -- an unmatched stderr must surface, not
//                         be guessed at.
//
// `retryable` means exactly one thing: SAFE TO RE-RUN THE SAME COMMAND WITH NO
// REMEDIATION FIRST. It is therefore false for AUTH_EXPIRED even though the
// auth self-heal path does retry once -- that retry is only legal AFTER
// re-provisioning, which is remediation. REMOTE_UNREACHABLE is false for the
// same "retrying cannot help" reason.

 * from an infrastructure dispatch failure (schema-repair exhaustion, a
 * dropped transport, etc -- see `dispatchFailed` on the synthesized
 * CHANGES_NEEDED verdict), never a genuine LLM verdict.
 *
 * Before this error existed, that same exhaustion threw
 * SprintPlanRejectedError -- indistinguishable from a REAL plan rejection by
 * the reviewer -- which misdiagnoses "the plan-reviewer's dispatch channel
 * never came back" as "the reviewer looked at the plan and rejected it".
 * The plan was never actually reviewed, so this is a distinct, infra-flavored
 * failure a human/CI should treat as "retry the sprint", not "fix the plan".
 *
 * Deliberately NOT one of isTypedAbortError()'s curated abort classes (see
 * runner.js): a dispatch-channel/transport blip is recoverable by simply
 * re-running the sprint, unlike a genuine stall/budget/reviewer-contract
 * abort or an unmergeable divergence, so it earns a terminal record (via
 * isTerminalSprintFailure()'s blanket WorkflowError match) but not the
 * push + [ABORTED] PR a real abort gets.

 * pre-dispatch pull, the LLM turn, and the post-dispatch sync in ONE bracket,
 * so a DoltSyncError thrown by doltPushGuarded propagated out of the whole
 * bracket. The Planner's PLANNER_DISPATCH_RETRY_DELAYS_MS ladder only saw "the
 * bracket threw" and called dispatchPlannerOnce() again -- redispatching a
 * brand-new Planner LLM turn even though the previous turn's output was already
 * safely committed in the member's local beads clone, purely because an
 * unrelated push step (e.g. missing VCS credentials) failed. Retry callers MUST
 * treat this error as "do not redispatch": the turn already happened.
