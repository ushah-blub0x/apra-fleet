/**
 * VCSModule -- orchestrator-side (fleet-se), provider-dispatched command
 * builder for VCS actions raised against a hosted repo provider.
 *
 * Architectural context (apra-fleet-tfx, correction note 2026-08-02): this
 * module lives in the orchestrator (fleet-se, alongside runner.js and the
 * server-side src/services/vcs/ provider seam -- see that seam's
 * VcsProviderService in src/services/vcs/types.ts, which this module's shape
 * mirrors/extends rather than inventing a parallel one). It NEVER runs on the
 * member and NEVER performs network I/O itself. Its only job is: given a
 * provider name and the already-minted credential, deterministically build
 * the exact command (a curl(1) invocation over the provider's REST API) that
 * the member will run via execute_command, plus the metadata a caller needs
 * to interpret that command's output (success / already-exists / error).
 *
 * The member is a dumb executor: it holds no VCS-abstraction code and makes
 * no choice about how the PR gets raised. No vendor CLI (`gh`, `hub`, ...)
 * appears anywhere in the commands this module builds, and there is no
 * server-side fallback -- callers that get an unsupported provider get a
 * clear ASCII "ERROR:" failure, never a silently wrong command.
 *
 * Token-safety invariant (apra-fleet-tfx.7 AC3): the raw token is placed only
 * in the `command` string that is actually dispatched for execution (never
 * echoed by curl itself -- no -v/--trace flag is ever added). Every field
 * meant for logs (`logSafeCommand`) has the token replaced with a fixed
 * redaction marker. Callers must log/echo `logSafeCommand`, never `command`.

// via their own single token field) so a caller (runner.js) never has to
// hardcode a provider-specific mode literal alongside the provider name.
// `null` means "this provider has no separate auth-mode choice at
// provision_vcs_auth call time". That per-provider default now lives as the
// `defaultAuthMode` field on the provider's OWN descriptor (see
// ./vcs-providers/github.mjs, ./vcs-providers/bitbucket.mjs,
// ./vcs-providers/azure-devops.mjs) rather than in a second provider-name-
// keyed table here.
//
// GitHub defaults to 'github-app' (never 'pat') because that is the mode
// runner.js has always hardcoded -- resolveProvider() must reproduce that
// exact behavior for every already-github-provisioned member, not merely a
// plausible one (apra-fleet-647.1.2.1 AC: "Existing GitHub members behave

 * guessing: an absent or unrecognized vcsProvider is a typed "ERROR:"
 * failure naming the member and the known providers, never a silent GitHub
 * assumption (apra-fleet-647.1.2's whole point).
 *
 * The known-provider vocabulary is listVcsAuthProviders() -- every registered
 * vcs-providers/ descriptor that declares its own `defaultAuthMode` (this
 * module's single manifest of member-facing VCS auth backends it is aware of

// UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION come last because their texts are the narrowest and
