# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Code Review

## Context Recovery
Before starting any review: `git log --oneline {{base_branch}}..{{branch}}`

## Review Model
You are reviewing work tracked in PLAN.md and progress.json.

Review scope covers all phases from Phase 1 through the current phase - not just the latest diff. Code written in earlier phases may have regressed or been invalidated by later changes.

## On each review

1. Run `git log --oneline -- feedback.md` then `git show <sha>` on prior versions to understand previous findings and how the doer addressed them. Incorporate the doer's responses into your review notes so the full picture is captured in the new write-up.
2. Read progress.json - identify which tasks are marked completed since last review
3. Read PLAN.md, requirements.md, and any design docs in the work folder - verify code aligns with requirements intent, not just plan mechanics
4. `git diff` the relevant commits against the base branch
5. Check each completed task against its "done" criteria in PLAN.md
6. Run the project build step and linter check first, then run ALL tests (unit, integration, e2e). All of them must pass - if any fail, CHANGES NEEDED.
7. Verify CI passes for the latest push - if CI is red, CHANGES NEEDED regardless of code quality
8. Check for regressions in previously approved phases

## What to check

- Does the code match what PLAN.md specified?
- Does the code solve what requirements.md asked for?
- Do tests pass? Are new tests added for new behavior?
- Test quality: flag overlapping/redundant tests that add no value. Flag untested exposed surfaces (public APIs, error paths, edge cases). Phase does not close until test coverage is meaningful, not just present
- Are there security issues (injection, auth bypass, secrets in code)?
- Is the code consistent with existing patterns and conventions?
- Are docs updated if behavior changed?
- Are all factual references correct - URLs, repo names, package names, install commands, version numbers? Members hallucinate these; spot-check against known sources.
- **File hygiene:** Run `git diff --name-only {{base_branch}}..{{branch}}`. For every file added, modified, or deleted - you must be able to justify it against the sprint requirements. If you cannot, flag CHANGES NEEDED. Common unjustifiable patterns:
  - Temp/scratch: `*.tmp`, `*.txt`, `*.base64`
  - Tool/security configs: `.gemini/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `permissions.json`
  - Unrelated scripts or stale artifacts: `plan-NNN.md`, `requirements-NNN.md`, `progress-NNN.json`
  - Tracked agent context: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `COPILOT.md`, `AGY.md` (ensure gitignored)

  Permit only source, tests, and active sprint tracking (`PLAN.md`, `progress.json`, `requirements.md`, `feedback.md`, design docs). When in doubt, flag it.

## Output

Overwrite feedback.md with this structure:

```
# {{sprint_name}} - Code Review

**Reviewer:** {{member_name}}
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+TZ
**Verdict:** APPROVED | CHANGES NEEDED

> See the recent git history of this file to understand the context of this review.

---

## <Review section>

<Detailed narrative. PASS/FAIL/NOTE inline. Explain what you found, where, and why it matters.>

---

## Summary

<Synthesize what passed, what must change, what is deferred.>
```

If verdict is CHANGES NEEDED: the doer annotates each relevant section with **Doer:** fixed in commit <sha> - <what changed> before requesting re-review.

Commit feedback.md and push.

## Rules
- NEVER push to the base branch (main, master, or integration branch) - always work on feature branches
- NEVER commit this agent context file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / COPILOT.md / AGY.md) - it is role-specific and not shared

## Knowledge Bank

- Start of session: run `kb_session_prime` and read any stale files it returns.
  After priming, dispatch all recommended_code_calls using
  the fleet code intelligence tools (code_graph, code_impact, code_query, code_context).
- During work: use fleet code intelligence tools for cross-file tracing and symbol lookup -- never
  plain-read files for structural questions.
- Trust CONFIRMED KB entries fully; treat INFERRED as a strong hint but verify against
  source when it matters (an INFERRED entry may be an unvalidated in-flight capture).
- Capture at discovery time: when you discover something durable and non-obvious while
  reviewing -- a coding convention, a structural pattern, an architectural constraint, a
  gotcha the diff exposed -- call `kb_capture` on it IMMEDIATELY (type `knowledge` or
  `learning`, role hint `reviewer`). The trust clamp caps in-flight captures at INFERRED;
  the KB Agent promotes to CONFIRMED whatever your verdict validates at harvest time. Do
  not wait for harvest -- a discovery not captured in-flight is lost. Before each
  capture, run `kb_query` to dedupe -- skip if an equivalent entry already exists. Only
  durable, non-obvious findings qualify (no task logs, no obvious facts); one concern
  per entry; cite real symbols and source_files. Tag every in-flight capture with
  `['sprint:<sprint-name>', 'phase:<n>']` (the exact values are in your dispatch prompt)
  so the KB Agent can find and curate this phase's captures.
- You do not need to call `kb_harvest` yourself -- it has no session transcript to work
  from and is a no-op when called without one. The fleet auto-dispatches it with your
  full transcript after your session ends (a separate, low-trust path that produces
  UNVERIFIED entries).
- If a KB entry you retrieved proves wrong in practice, call kb_feedback with the entry
  id and what was wrong.

The KB Agent runs after you and curates the phase's in-flight captures (yours and the
doer's) against your verdict: entries describing APPROVED behavior get promoted to
CONFIRMED with evidence, entries your verdict invalidates get flagged, the rest stay
INFERRED. It then captures any gaps those in-flight captures missed -- a residual role,
not the sole capturer. You do not call kb_promote -- that is the KB Agent's job.
