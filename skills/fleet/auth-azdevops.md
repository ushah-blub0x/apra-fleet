# Azure DevOps Authentication

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) with configurable scopes and expiration. Auth: empty username, PAT as password.

## Setup

1. Go to `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_settings/tokens`
2. Click "New Token"
3. Set descriptive name (e.g., "fleet-{name}")
4. Select required scopes (see below)
5. Set expiration (recommend: 90 days)
6. Copy token - shown only once
7. Provide token and org URL when prompted

### Expiry Capture (Optional)

When first registering a PAT, you can optionally capture its expiration date by passing `pat_expires_at` (ISO 8601, e.g. `2027-08-20T00:00:00Z`) to `provision_vcs_auth`. Azure DevOps exposes no API to read a PAT's expiry back, so this value must come from the operator -- the date chosen in the "Set expiration" step above. It is validated at the schema boundary and rejected if unparseable. The fleet stores this expiry date and checks it against two separate thresholds (see `src/utils/agent-helpers.ts`):

- **Minute-scale warning** (`EXPIRY_WARNING_MS`, 10 minutes): fires for any provider once the credential is within 10 minutes of expiry. This threshold was sized for GitHub App tokens (~1hr lifetime).
- **Day-scale warning** (`DAY_SCALE_WARNING_MS`, 7 days): fires only for providers listed in `DAY_SCALE_WARNING_PROVIDERS`, which currently includes `azure-devops`. Because Azure DevOps PATs run weeks to months (see "Set expiration" above), this gives a heads-up long before the minute-scale check would ever fire.

Either warning causes the fleet to request a fresh provisioning before the sprint dispatch rather than failing mid-sprint when the credential becomes invalid.

This step is optional; PATs function normally even without expiry tracking. However, recording expiry dates helps prevent surprise authentication failures and reduces retry cycles.

## Deploy

```
provision_vcs_auth(member_id, provider: 'azure-devops', org_url: 'https://dev.azure.com/myorg', pat: '...', pat_expires_at: '2027-08-20T00:00:00Z')
```

## Secret-Name Convention

The Azure DevOps PAT is stored in the fleet's credential store under a configurable name. **Default:** `azdevops_pat`

The credential is entered via the out-of-band prompt during `provision_vcs_auth` and is stored as a secure placeholder. When used in `execute_command` calls, the fleet resolves the placeholder on the server side - the plaintext token never appears in logs, prompts, or LLM transcripts.

**Store or reference the default credential:**

```
credential_store_set  name=azdevops_pat
execute_command  command="curl -sf -u :{{secure.azdevops_pat}} 'https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_apis/projects?api-version=7.1'"
```

**Per-sprint override:** To use a different credential name for a specific sprint (for example, when working with a different Azure DevOps organization or test repo), pass the `azdevops_pat_secret_name` argument to the sprint invocation (threaded through `packages/apra-fleet-se/fleet-sprint/runner.js`). It must name a credential already stored via `credential_store_set`; the runner validates it as a credential-store name at contract-validation time and uses it instead of the default `azdevops_pat` entry for provisioning, self-heal, and preflight checks on that sprint.

## Scopes

| Role | PAT Scopes |
|------|-----------|
| development | Code: R&W, Pull Request Threads: R&W |
| code-review | Code: Read, Pull Request Threads: R&W |
| testing | Code: Read, Build: Read |
| devops | Full access, or Code + Build + Release: R&W |
| debugging | Code: Read |

Union of all roles assigned to the member.

## Test

```bash
curl -sf -u :pat "https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_apis/projects?api-version=7.1&\$top=1"
git ls-remote https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo} HEAD
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| 401 Unauthorized | Create new PAT and re-deploy |
| 403 Forbidden | Create PAT with broader scopes |
| TF400813: Resource not available | Verify org URL matches `https://dev.azure.com/{org}` |
| Clone prompts for password | Re-run `provision_vcs_auth` |

## PAT Lifetime and Expiry

A fleet provisioning Azure DevOps credentials **cannot self-extend or auto-renew a PAT**. The Azure DevOps PAT lifecycle management API requires an Entra (Azure AD) OAuth token with admin consent, which the fleet does not hold. This is a fundamental design constraint: the fleet stores only the PAT itself, never the credentials needed to mint a fresh PAT or extend an existing one.

**Implications:**

- PATs must be renewed manually before expiry by re-running `provision_vcs_auth` and providing a fresh token.
- The optional expiry capture (see Setup section above) enables day-scale preflight warnings so the sprint can request a fresh provisioning before the credential becomes invalid.
- If a PAT expires mid-sprint, the sprint will fail with auth errors until `provision_vcs_auth` is re-run with a valid token.

To avoid disruption, set a calendar reminder to renew PATs well before their expiry date, or use the optional expiry-capture feature to let the fleet warn you in advance.

## Storing tokens for reuse

After provisioning VCS auth, you can store the Azure DevOps PAT in the credential store (see Secret-Name Convention section above) for direct use in `execute_command` - for example, calling the Azure DevOps REST API or authenticating git operations manually.

**Store an Azure DevOps PAT for reuse:**

```
credential_store_set  name=azdevops_pat
```

**Use it in a command on a member:**

```
execute_command  command="curl -sf -u :{{secure.azdevops_pat}} 'https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_apis/projects?api-version=7.1'"
execute_command  command="git remote set-url origin https://token:{{secure.azdevops_pat}}@dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}"
```

The token is resolved server-side and redacted in output (`[REDACTED:azdevops_pat]`) - it never appears in the LLM conversation or command logs.

## Notes

- PAT expiration: default 30 days, max 1 year
- Azure DevOps does not support app-based tokens - PATs are the standard
- Org URL must be base URL without trailing path
