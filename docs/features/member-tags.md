# Member Category and Tags

## Overview

Each registered member (Agent) can carry two classification fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `category` | `string` (optional) | Free-text label used to group members in display output |
| `tags` | `string[]` (optional) | Arbitrary keyword set for filtering and skill-matrix matching |

Both fields are backward compatible -- they default to `undefined` and existing members without them behave identically to before.

## Data Model

Defined in `src/types.ts` on the `Agent` interface:

```typescript
category?: string;
tags?: string[];
```

### Constraints (enforced by Zod schemas in register-member.ts and update-member.ts)

- `tags`: maximum 10 elements; each element maximum 64 characters
- `category`: free text, trimmed on write; empty string is stored as `undefined`
- Passing `tags: []` in `update_member` clears the tags field (stored as `undefined`)

## Validation

Both `registerMemberSchema` and `updateMemberSchema` include identical Zod constraints:

```typescript
tags: z.array(z.string().max(64)).max(10).optional()
category: z.string().optional()
```

Boundary behaviour: exactly 10 tags of 64 chars each is valid; 11 tags or a 65-char tag is rejected with a Zod validation error.

## Display

Tags and category are surfaced in `check_status` and `list_members` output:

- **Compact text format**: members are grouped by category (alphabetically; `(uncategorized)` always last). Tags are shown as a comma-separated inline list after the member line.
- **JSON format**: `category` and `tags` are included as-is in the JSON member object.

## groupByCategory Utility

`src/utils/agent-helpers.ts` exports `groupByCategory<T>()`:

```typescript
function groupByCategory<T>(
  items: T[],
  getCategory: (item: T) => string | null | undefined,
): { grouped: Map<string, T[]>; sortedKeys: string[] }
```

- Returns a `Map` keyed by category string and an array of sorted keys.
- Items with no category (null, undefined, or empty) are grouped under the key `"(uncategorized)"`.
- Alphabetical sort with `"(uncategorized)"` pinned last.

## MCP Tool Interface

### register_member

Optional parameters added:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `category` | string (optional) | Category label for display grouping |
| `tags` | string[] (optional) | Up to 10 keyword tags, max 64 chars each |

### update_member

Same parameters as register_member. Semantics:

- `category: ""` clears the category (stored as undefined)
- `tags: []` clears all tags (stored as undefined)
- Omitting `tags` entirely leaves the existing tags unchanged

## Tag-Based Permission Composition (Phase 2)

Tags drive `compose_permissions` via the `tags` parameter. The tool maps tags to
permission profiles stored under `skills/fleet/profiles/tag-<name>.json`.

Key rules:
- Reserved tags `doer` and `reviewer` determine the primary mode (base-dev or base-reviewer profile).
- If neither is present, `doer` is the default.
- All other tags load `tag-<name>.json` and merge additively.
- Unknown tags (no matching profile file) are silently ignored.
- When both `role` and `tags` are supplied, `tags` wins.

`composeFromTags(tags, agent, projectFolder)` in `src/tools/compose-permissions.ts` is
the entry point. It is byte-identical in output to `compose(role, agent, projectFolder)`
when `tags` contains exactly `["doer"]` or `["reviewer"]` -- full backward compatibility.

Example tag profiles shipped with Fleet:
- `tag-gpu.json` -- grants GPU-related tool scopes for build/test
- `tag-devops.json` -- grants CI/CD and container tool scopes

## Tag-Based Member Filtering (Phase 5)

`list_members` accepts a `tags` parameter. Semantics: AND filter -- only members that
carry ALL of the supplied tags are returned. Single-tag and multi-tag cases are both
supported. Omitting `tags` returns all members (existing behavior unchanged).

The filter is applied before display grouping, so the output is still grouped by
category with the same compact/JSON format.

## Skill Matrix Utility (Phase 3)

`src/utils/skill-matrix.ts` exports `getRequiredSkills(tags, vcs, project?)`:

```typescript
function getRequiredSkills(
  tags: string[],
  vcs: VcsProvider,
  project?: string,
): string[]
```

- Returns the deduplicated, sorted list of skill names required for a member.
- Encodes the rules in `skills/fleet/skill-matrix.md` programmatically.
- Members with no relevant tags return an empty array (not an error).
- Currently used in tests and as a documentation companion; not yet wired into the
  installer's onboarding path.

## Architecture Invariants

- Tags and category are purely metadata -- they do not affect dispatch routing, SSH
  transport, or session management.
- The `groupByCategory` utility is generic (`<T>`) and reusable for any item type.
- `getRequiredSkills()` is a pure function with no side effects and no I/O.
- Permission merges are always additive (Set-based); no permission is ever removed by
  adding a tag.

## Phases Implemented vs Planned

| 3 | apra-fleet-51i | Done | Tag-aware skill matrix (skill-matrix.ts + skill-matrix.md update) |
| 4 | apra-fleet-6ky | Done | permissions.md updated for tag-based composition |
| 5 | apra-fleet-4xe | Done | Tag filter param in list_members (AND semantics) |
