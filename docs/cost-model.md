# Cost

Multi-agent tooling raises one question first: does coordinating several agents
burn more tokens? In practice Fleet works to keep usage down -- and the core
idea is the one Fleet was built on: **match the model to the task.**

A plan is a list of tasks of widely varying difficulty. Running every one of
them on a single premium model is the waste. Instead, Fleet assigns each task a
model tier commensurate with its complexity:

- **cheap** -- boilerplate, status checks, running tests, deploys
- **standard** -- routine feature work, code, configuration
- **premium** -- planning, review, hard architectural reasoning

Only the work that genuinely needs a frontier model gets one; everything else
runs on a lighter, cheaper tier. Two more mechanisms compound the savings:

- **Shell over prompts** -- routine steps run through `execute_command` as plain
  shell commands, which cost zero LLM tokens.
- **Smart sessions** -- Fleet decides whether to resume an existing session
  (reusing cached context) or start fresh, rather than re-sending history.

**Token spend is measured, not estimated.** Fleet records token usage per
member and per role -- PM, doer, reviewer -- so a team can see and analyze
where their spend actually goes. Fleet's end-to-end CI suite exercises this
in full: a complete reviewed sprint -- discover issues, plan, doer-reviewer
loop, PR raised with green CI -- emits a per-role token breakdown (in one
such run: PM ~6K, doer ~191K, reviewer ~19K, ~215K total). Those toy-repo
figures are not a benchmark -- they show the measurement method works end
to end. The point is the instrument: Fleet makes token cost something you
can attribute and reason about, not guess at.

Setup is a one-time cost; the recurring cost is the work itself. See the
[FAQ](FAQ.md) for the full breakdown.

## Per-phase honesty in the sprint cost report

The sprint cost-analysis breakdown gives Integ Test its own line, separate
from doer/reviewer/overhead. Integ Test dispatches are often the single
longest and most expensive phase of a cycle (they routinely burn a large
turn budget re-verifying a change), so folding their spend into a generic
"overhead" bucket would systematically hide where the money actually went.

A dispatch that exhausts its turn ceiling or times out still gets its
partial token usage recorded and priced, rather than being reported as an
undefined/zero cost. A run that took hours and produced a real (if partial)
usage figure must never show up as cheaper than a run that finished cleanly
in minutes just because the expensive run didn't complete cleanly -- an
undercounted total is worse than an admittedly-partial one, because it
looks precise while being wrong. Where a dispatch's cost genuinely cannot be
priced (an unpriced model id, a dispatch that never ran at all), the report
says so explicitly rather than silently substituting zero.
