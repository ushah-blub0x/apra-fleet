# Architecture & Safety Rationalization: Google Antigravity (agy) Integration

> **Internal document** -- architectural rationale for contributors and reviewers, not user-facing guidance. For user setup instructions see [docs/install.md](install.md).
>
> **Historical note:** this document records the state of the codebase at the time of the `feat/agy-support` integration, when the legacy Gemini provider adapter was still present (already being demoted in favor of AGY). Gemini has since been fully removed as a supported provider; references to it below are preserved as historical record, not current guidance.

This document rationalizes the design decisions, safety mechanisms, and compatibility considerations implemented for the Google Antigravity CLI (provider key: "agy") support in apra-fleet.

## 1. Executive Summary

The "feat/agy-support" branch introduces Google Antigravity CLI ("agy") as a primary, PM-capable LLM provider alongside "claude", while demoting the slower legacy "gemini" provider adapter.

Integration safety was verified against the following criteria:
- Isolation: Integration must not corrupt global configuration settings or conflict with other tool environments.
- Security: Credentials must be encrypted at rest, transmitted securely, and never leaked in execution logs.
- Stability: Unsupported options (such as live log tailing or model flags) must fail back gracefully without crashing execution pipelines.

The integration has achieved 100% test pass rate across 1,290+ unit and integration tests.

## 2. Installation & Cleanup Safety (install.ts / uninstall.ts)

### Change Rationalization
Unlike Claude or Gemini, the Antigravity CLI reads its global configurations (MCP servers and hooks) from separate JSON files located in a centralized config directory:
- MCP Config: "~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json"
- Hooks Config: "~/.gemini/config/hooks.json"

### Safety Mechanisms
- Surgical Merging: The installer ("src/cli/install.ts") does not overwrite these files. Instead, it reads the existing JSON, initializes the target configuration blocks if missing, and merges the "apra-fleet" configuration.
- Isolated Scope: The merged config is isolated:
  - Hooks: Only hooks matching "apra-fleet" are registered.
  - MCP: Only the "apra-fleet" server is registered under "mcpServers".
- Precision Uninstallation: During uninstallation, the cleanup scripts ("src/cli/uninstall.ts") read these files and delete only the "apra-fleet" hook matchers and MCP server entry, leaving all other user-configured tools and settings untouched.
- Directory Safeguards: All write operations utilize "fs.mkdirSync(..., { recursive: true })" to prevent errors if the directories do not exist.

## 3. Authentication & Credential Isolation (provision-auth.ts)

### Change Rationalization
Antigravity utilizes the "ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY" environment variable to authenticate requests. We unified authentication provisioning to support local and remote members securely.

### Safety Mechanisms
- Local Exemption: Local members automatically skip LLM auth provisioning as they run on the host machine and inherit active host credentials directly.
- Remote Encryption: For remote members, if an API key is supplied or collected:
  - The plaintext key is transferred securely over the SSH channel.
  - The key is written to the remote shell profiles (e.g. .bashrc, .bash_profile) using OS-specific commands.
  - The key is stored in the local registry encrypted using the "encryptPassword" utility.
- OOB Fallback: If no API key is specified, the system falls back to Out-Of-Band (OOB) prompt collection, requesting the user to enter the key in a secure prompt, avoiding credential storage in command history.
- OAuth Safety: Agy returns "supportsOAuthCopy() -> false" and "oauthCredentialFiles() -> null", ensuring that no OAuth credential copy routines (which are Claude-specific) are executed.

## 4. Permission Composition & Execution Isolation (agy.ts / compose-permissions.ts)

### Change Rationalization
When a member executes a task, it must run under a strictly bounded execution profile to prevent privilege escalation or recursive loops (e.g. the member invoking the fleet server recursively).

### Safety Mechanisms
- Localized Directory Config: "permissionConfigPaths()" returns ".gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json". This writes permission settings relative to the workspace folder of the active task, confining the member's sandbox to that repository.
- Loop Prevention: "composePermissionConfig" generates the following configuration:
  - Disables the "apra-fleet" MCP server on the member: "mcpServers: { 'apra-fleet': { disabled: true } }".
  - Disables fleet orchestration skills: "skillOverrides: { pm: 'off', fleet: 'off' }".
  This completely prevents recursive prompt dispatch loops where the agent could attempt to orchestrate itself.

---

## 5. Execution & Command Routing Safety (execute-prompt.ts)

### Change Rationalization
We added custom model tier mappings ("cheap", "standard", "premium") and model list validation to ensure that execution dispatches remain robust.

### Safety Mechanisms
- Curated Tier Validation: To prevent invalid model names from being passed to providers, we introduced three curated model arrays in "src/cli/config.ts" ("CURATED_CHEAP_MODELS", "CURATED_STANDARD_MODELS", "CURATED_PREMIUM_MODELS"). These are enforced via Zod schemas during member registration and update.
- Flag Suppression: Antigravity CLI does not support a native "--model" command-line flag (it selects the model based on its settings/profile). "AgyProvider.modelFlag()" returns an empty string "". This avoids syntax errors during execution command generation, preventing failures when custom models are configured on the member.

---

## 6. Session Resume & Log Polling Limitations (log-path-resolver.ts)

### Change Rationalization
Agy supports session resumption via the "--conversation <sessionId>" flag. However, it stores conversation logs in a binary Protocol Buffer format (".pb") under "~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/<sessionId>.pb", unlike Claude's text-based JSONL files.

### Safety Mechanisms & Graceful Fallback
- Log Polling Skip: Tail-polling binary files is highly error-prone and would result in corrupted output or crash the log parsing parser. Thus, "resolveSessionLogPath" explicitly throws an error for "agy":
  "Unsupported log polling for provider: agy"
- Graceful Degradation: The execution harness catches this exception and falls back to transport-level inactivity monitoring (silence timeout) and wall-clock total timeouts.
- Thread Safety: Prompt execution remains fully functional and robust. The only trade-off is that the PM server relies on console output/timeouts rather than parsing internal agent log files during prompt execution, which is the identical safe fallback behavior used for Codex and Copilot.

---

## 7. Verification Results

- All 1,290+ vitest tests pass successfully, confirming that the new "agy" adapter does not introduce regressions to Claude, Gemini, Codex, or Copilot.
- The single-executable installer build ("npm run build:binary") successfully compiles with all multi-provider config modifications packaged.
