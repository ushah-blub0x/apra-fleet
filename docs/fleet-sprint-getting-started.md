## 1. What fleet-sprint does

fleet-sprint is a program that runs a full development cycle on your codebase
without a person driving each step. You give it a scoped batch of work (a set of
issues with clear acceptance criteria), a git branch to work on, and at least one
registered machine running an AI coding agent. It then runs, in a loop, until the
work is done or it hits a limit you set:

1. **Plan.** An AI "planner" reads your issues and breaks them into small,
   concrete tasks -- each with written acceptance criteria and an explicit
   dependency order. A second AI ("plan-reviewer") checks that plan for coverage,
   task size, and testability before anything is built. The plan is not a
   document; it is written directly into the issue tracker, so every later step
   reads the same source of truth.
2. **Develop and review.** An AI "doer" implements the tasks -- real code, real
   commits on your branch, one commit per task. After each round, a separate AI
   "reviewer" diffs the branch against the acceptance criteria and either
   approves or sends specific tasks back with reasons. The reviewer can reopen
   tasks; the engine (deterministic code, not an AI) applies every state change,
   so nothing is closed on an AI's say-so alone.
3. **Deploy and integration-test** (only if you provide the runbooks -- see
   Section 2). A "deployer" follows your written deploy instructions to stand the
   software up, and an "integration test runner" follows your written test
   playbook to verify features end-to-end against the running software. Features
   are only marked done on passing evidence; failures become new bug issues that
   feed the next cycle.
4. **Evaluate.** The engine looks at real issue-tracker state and decides: done,
   or run another cycle (up to a ceiling you set, default 5).

When the loop ends, a finalization pass runs: a reviewer renders an
evidence-based **PASS or FAIL verdict** for the whole sprint, a "harvester"
writes durable documentation and a changelog entry (including a cost breakdown),
an optional once-per-sprint regression pass runs your regression playbook, and
the engine pushes the branch and **opens a pull request** whose title and body
state the verdict plainly. It never merges the PR -- that is always a human
decision.

</picture>

Concretely, after a run finishes, here is what has changed in your world:

- Your repo has a new branch with a series of reviewed commits and an open PR
  against the base branch you chose.
- Your issue tracker (beads -- see Section 2) has the sprint's issues decomposed,
  worked, and closed-with-evidence or left open with filed bugs explaining why.
- A sprint analysis document is committed to the branch (under `sprint-logs/`),
  and the run's raw log is retained on disk.

What it is *not*: it does not invent product scope (the planner is explicitly
forbidden from adding work beyond the issues you gave it), it does not merge its
own PRs, and it does not know how to deploy or verify your software unless you
write down how (Section 2).

---

## 2. What you need before you start

This is the honest part. fleet-sprint automates execution; it does not automate
knowing your project. Four things are yours to build first, and none of them are
generated for you.

### 2.1 Your Azure DevOps / GitHub Issues epics need equivalents in beads

fleet-sprint tracks all work in **beads** (`bd`), a git-friendly issue tracker:
the data lives in your repo clone and syncs through your existing git remote, no
extra server. That is where the sprint's plan gets written, where acceptance
criteria live, and where closure evidence is recorded. For this guide, that is
all you need to know about beads internals.

Before a sprint can run, the work in scope must exist there: one epic bead as the
sprint root, with the in-scope features/stories as its children (created or
linked with `--parent` -- the engine resolves a sprint's scope by following
parent links from the root id you launch with).

Getting your backlog in is better than we expected: beads ships native
integrations for **both** Azure DevOps and GitHub Issues, built on a common sync
engine.

**Azure DevOps.** `bd ado sync --pull-only` bulk-pulls work items from an
AzDevOps org/project, `bd ado pull` fetches specific items. Configured via
`bd config` or env vars: organization, project, PAT.

**GitHub Issues.** `bd github sync` synchronizes issues, and it is
**bidirectional by default** -- it pulls new/updated issues from GitHub into
beads *and* pushes local beads issues back to GitHub. Constrain the direction
explicitly until you know you want two-way traffic:

```bash
bd config set github.token  "$GITHUB_TOKEN"   # or env: GITHUB_TOKEN
bd config set github.owner  "your-org"        # or env: GITHUB_OWNER
bd config set github.repo   "your-repo"       # or env: GITHUB_REPO

bd github sync --pull-only        # GitHub -> beads only (start here)
bd github sync --dry-run          # show what would sync, change nothing
bd github pull  <refs...>         # fetch specific issues
bd github status                  # current config + sync status
```

Useful flags on `bd github sync`: `--issues` (comma-separated bead ids) and
`--parent` (limit a push to one bead and its descendants) to scope a sync, and
`--prefer-newer` (the default), `--prefer-github` or `--prefer-local` to settle
conflicts. GitHub Enterprise is supported via `github.url` / `GITHUB_API_URL`.

For anything else, the generic `bd import` accepts JSONL on a file or stdin
(`title` is the only required field; `external_ref` / `source_system` carry
cross-system ids). All of the above was checked against the installed `bd` CLI
(`bd github --help`, `bd github sync --help`, `bd ado --help`, `bd import --help`)
and the beads documentation.

Two honest caveats.

1. This is upstream **beads** functionality, not something apra-fleet adds or
   wraps -- apra-fleet knows Azure DevOps and GitHub only as git hosts (credential
   provisioning for push/PR). Validate the sync against your own org before
   relying on it, and prefer `--pull-only` / `--dry-run` on the first run, since
   `bd github sync` will otherwise push your beads back into GitHub.
2. An imported work item is not automatically sprint-ready: most AzDevOps and
   GitHub issues lack the concrete acceptance criteria every sprint role depends
   on -- the planner decomposes from them, the doer is instructed to *skip* beads
   without them rather than guess, and the reviewer diffs against them.

So the real work is curation, not transcription: parent the in-scope items under
one root and write down what "done" looks like for each. One epic with 3-8
well-described children is enough for a first sprint.

### 2.2 Write `deploy.md` -- fleet-sprint cannot write it for you

`deploy.md` lives at your repo root and is a literal runbook: the deployer agent
reads it and executes it, command by command. Its contract (from the deployer's
own role definition):

- `## Deploy` -- the commands to deploy/stand up the software, in order.
- `## Smoke test` -- one command; exit code 0 means healthy.
- `## Permissions` (optional but recommended) -- the command prefixes the agent
  needs allowed in its CLI permission settings. The deployer checks this *before
  running anything* and stops with a clear report if your allowlist is missing
  entries, rather than failing mid-deploy.
- A sandbox / isolated test-deploy mode (optional) -- if `deploy.md` distinguishes
  one from its production deploy, sprint-dispatched deploys (always for
  integration/regression testing) use it, leave the instance running for the
  test phase, and your test playbooks own its teardown. Every phase's dispatch
  prompt carries the sprint's own `sprintId` line, so a runbook can key the
  instance's location on it.

The deployer is explicitly forbidden from improvising: if `deploy.md` is absent,
the deploy and integration-test phases are **skipped cleanly** -- the sprint still
runs, but nothing gets verified against a running system. If a step fails, it
stops and reports the exact command and output; it never "works around" your
deploy process.

Why you must write it: fleet-sprint has no idea whether your app is a Docker
compose stack, an IIS site, a Kubernetes deployment, or `npm start` -- and
guessing at deployment is exactly the class of action you do not want an
autonomous agent doing. Minimum viable version: the commands you already run by
hand to start the app locally, plus one curl or CLI call that proves it is up.

### 2.3 Write an integration test playbook and a regression test playbook

These are **instruction files a human writes**, not test code. They tell the
test-runner agents how to verify the software works. If you have zero automated
tests today -- which is our assumption about you -- that is workable: a playbook
can start life as written-down manual verification steps (commands to run,
outputs to check), and grow more automated over time.

**`integ-test-playbook.md`** (repo root) -- read every cycle by the integration
test runner after a successful deploy. It describes how to exercise the deployed
software and how to judge pass/fail. The runner closes a feature only when its
tests pass, files a bug bead (with expected vs actual, output, and repro steps)
when they fail, and never writes or fixes code itself. Note the division of
labor: per-feature *test code* is written during the sprint by the doer (the
planner creates a `[test]` task for every feature); the playbook is the stable,
environment-level "how do we run and verify things here" document. Minimum viable
version: a `## Permissions` section, how to reach the deployed app
(URL/port/paths), and how to run and interpret whatever checks exist -- even if
that is three curl commands and what their responses should contain.

**`regression-test-playbook.md`** (repo root) -- run **once per sprint**, near the
end, by a separate regression runner that owns a sandbox lifecycle (`## Setup`, a
test scenario, `## Teardown` -- teardown always runs, pass or fail). Its job is
proving *existing* functionality still works. Two honest softeners for a team
starting from zero: (a) its result is explicitly informational -- it never gates
the sprint's PASS/FAIL verdict; failures are filed as standalone "carry-over"
bugs for a future sprint; and (b) if the file is absent, the phase is skipped with
a warning. So you can defer this one -- but a sprint with no regression pass has
no systematic check that it didn't break what already worked, and with no unit
tests either, your only safety nets are the reviewer's diff reading and your own
PR review. Plan to add it by your second or third sprint.

### 2.4 Register at least one fleet member

A **member** is a real machine (or just a separate folder on your machine) with a
provider CLI -- for you, Claude Code -- and a working directory containing a clone
of your repo. The fleet server dispatches all agent work to members.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../assets/marketing/fleet-topology-dark.svg">
  <img src="../assets/marketing/fleet-topology-light.svg" alt="apra-fleet topology: a control plane dispatching agent work to registered members across machines and providers.">
</picture>

fleet-sprint ships inside the `@apralabs/apra-fleet` package. Install it from npm
(Node.js 22+):

```bash
npm install -g @apralabs/apra-fleet
apra-fleet                                # installs for Claude Code (default)
cd ~/.apra-fleet/bin && apra-fleet start  # start the fleet server
```

Alternatively, download the standalone installer for your platform from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Apra-Labs/apra-fleet/releases)
(`apra-fleet-installer-darwin-arm64`, `apra-fleet-installer-linux-x64`,
`apra-fleet-installer-win-x64.exe`) and run it -- installation is the default
action. Either way, the fleet runtime is unpacked into `~/.apra-fleet/` with the
`apra-fleet` binary at `~/.apra-fleet/bin`.

Then load the fleet MCP server in Claude Code (`/mcp`) and register members
conversationally -- registration is driven through your agent in plain language,
e.g. "Register a local member called `dev1`, work folder `C:\work\myapp`."
Registration validates connectivity and that the CLI is present; remote machines
work over SSH, with passwords collected out-of-band (never typed into the chat).

One member is enough to start, and a single-member sprint avoids the multi-clone
topology questions entirely. You will also want git credentials provisioned for
the member so it can push the branch and open the PR -- apra-fleet's
`provision_vcs_auth` supports **GitHub**, Bitbucket, and **Azure DevOps** (org URL
+ PAT), so a GitHub- or AzDevOps-hosted git repo is fully supported.

### 2.5 Scale sideways: one member per sprint, several sprints at once

The way to get more work done in parallel is **more sprints, not more agents
inside one sprint**. Register several members and run a separate sprint on each --
one member, one branch, one slice of the backlog per sprint. Three members
running three independent sprints is a configuration that gets real daily use.

The supervisor is built for exactly this: it holds a reservation ledger over
members and issue scopes, refuses a launch whose member or issue scope collides
with an already-running sprint (HTTP 409 naming the conflict), and shows a member
as *reserved* in the launch form while it is busy. Each sprint gets its own
branch, its own PR, and its own dashboard, so the runs stay independent all the
way to review.

Assigning several doers to a *single* sprint is a different thing, and an untested
one -- the launch form will let you tick several members for one sprint, but that
configuration has not been exercised in practice, so treat it as experimental.
Start with one member per sprint and add sprints, not doers.

---

## 3. How do I run it

Not by invoking a CLI directly. The supported entry point is the **always-on
supervisor** (`fleet-se-serve`), a small local HTTP service (default port 8787)
that owns a reservation ledger -- it knows which members and which issue scopes
are already claimed by a running sprint, and refuses launches that would collide
(an HTTP 409 naming the conflicting sprint). Launching a sprint is one POST:

```jsonc
POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/sprints
{
  "issue":   "myapp-epic-1",          // your epic bead id (comma-separate for multiple roots)
  "members": ["dev1"],                // registered member name(s)
  "branch":  "sprint/checkout-v2",    // the branch the sprint develops on (created if absent)
  "base":    "main",                  // what the branch forks from and the PR targets
  "goal":    "P1/P2",                 // optional: priority ceiling for "done"
  "maxCycles": 5,                     // optional
  "budget":  25,                      // optional: USD ceiling for the run
  "requirementsFile": "docs/checkout-v2-requirements.md"   // optional, see Section 5
}
```

The request is validated before anything spawns (malformed issue ids, branch
names, or empty member lists are rejected with a 400 naming the field), then the
sprint starts as a detached child process and the response gives you a
`sprintId`, the child's dashboard port, and the path to its raw log file.
`POST /api/sprints/<id>/stop` stops it cooperatively. There is also a launch form
in the supervisor's web dashboard that submits through this exact same endpoint,
so point-and-click and API launches can never diverge.

> **A useful guard worth knowing on day one:** if a previous run of the same epic
> ended in a failure the engine classifies as deterministic (it would just happen
> again), a relaunch is refused with a 409 until you either fix the cause or pass
> an explicit override flag. The system prefers telling you "this will fail again"
> over silently burning another run.

---

## 4. How do I know what's happening

Open the supervisor's page in a browser (`http://localhost:8787`). It renders
three things, and they answer the three questions stakeholders actually ask:

- **What is running right now?** One section per live sprint: branch, goal, a
  four-state health badge from the supervisor's watchdog, the members and issue
  scope it has claimed, and a link into that sprint's live view, its raw log, and
  Stop and Restart controls.
- **What is free to work on?** The full backlog rendered as a tree, minus whatever
  running sprints have claimed, recomputed live -- so two sprints can never be
  pointed at the same work by accident.
- **How do I start another one?** The launch form (issue picker fed from the
  backlog, member and role assignment, goal, branch naming).

![Supervisor index, Sprints tab: the running sprint with its health badge, branch, goal, claimed bead scope and members, plus per-sprint Open live view, Raw log, Stop and Restart controls.](../assets/marketing/supervisor-sprints.png)

*Supervisor index, Sprints tab (`http://localhost:8787`).*

![Supervisor index, Backlog tab: the bead backlog as a filterable table with search and type, status, priority and model filters.](../assets/marketing/supervisor-backlog.png)

*Supervisor index, Backlog tab.*

![The Launch Sprint panel: a member list with a role dropdown per member, a goal selector, branch and base-branch fields, an override-relaunch-gate checkbox and a Launch Sprint button.](../assets/marketing/supervisor-launch-form.png)

*The Launch Sprint panel, at the foot of the Backlog tab.*

![A sprint's live view: activity tree of commands and agent dispatches grouped by sprint cycle and phase, each row timestamped with its duration, model tier and status, above a header showing activity count, dollars spent, tokens and uptime.](../assets/marketing/sprint-live-view.png)

*A sprint's live view, Activity Tree tab.*

Clicking into a live sprint gives the per-sprint dashboard: phases and agent
dispatches streaming in as they happen, **token and dollar cost totals** accruing
live, a Stop button, a live rendering of the beads work graph (which tasks exist,
which are in progress, which closed) and -- at the end -- a **verdict badge** (PASS
in green, FAIL in red) with a direct **link to the opened PR**. Every sprint's raw
output is also captured to a per-sprint log file linked from the dashboard, so
even a run that crashes before reporting anything structured leaves a traceable
trail.

A non-engineer can get real signal from a glance: how many sprints are running,
whether any health badge is red, what the spend is so far, and -- once finished --
PASS or FAIL and a PR link. The deliverable a human ultimately reviews is that PR:
reviewed commits, a verdict stated plainly in the PR title/body, an updated
changelog with a cost breakdown, and a written sprint analysis document committed
under `sprint-logs/` on the branch.

---

## 5. How do architecture decisions and conventions get communicated

There is no dedicated "architecture decision record" input to fleet-sprint. Here
is what actually exists, verified against the code and the shipped role contracts,
ordered by reach:

1. **`bd remember` -- durable knowledge that reaches every role.** Beads has a
   persistent-memory store: `bd remember --key <key> "<one or two sentences>"`
   writes an entry into the shared beads database, and `bd prime` (beads'
   context-recovery command) prints every stored memory in a "Persistent Memories"
   section, searchable via `bd memories <keyword>`. The delivery path: beads'
   convention -- used by this repo itself, whose checked-in
   `.claude/settings.json` is exactly this -- is a Claude Code `SessionStart` hook
   that runs `bd prime`, so *every* agent session opened in the repo gets the
   memories as session context. Since each dispatched sprint role (planner, doer,
   reviewer, test runners) runs as a Claude Code session inside the member's
   working copy, a repo carrying that hook delivers your recorded conventions to
   all of them. Two verified caveats: the fleet-sprint engine does **not** run
   `bd prime` or inject memories into dispatch prompts itself (the hook in your
   repo is the whole mechanism), and it is a Claude Code/Codex hook convention;
   other provider CLIs handle session context differently. For standing direction
   like "all new endpoints go through the gateway service" or "no new runtime
   dependencies without approval", this is the closest thing to a real cross-role
   channel that exists.
2. **The requirements file (`requirementsFile` on the launch request).** The one
   explicit per-sprint channel: the engine reads the file and pastes its content
   verbatim into the **planner's** prompt. Use it for sprint-specific technical
   direction that should shape decomposition. Honest limit: it reaches the planner
   (and is readable by the harvester), not the doer -- direction that implementers
   must follow needs mechanism 1 or 3.
3. **Bead descriptions and acceptance criteria.** The highest-fidelity channel to
   the agents writing the code: the planner must give every task concrete
   acceptance criteria, the doer implements to them, the reviewer diffs against
   them. If a constraint matters for a specific piece of work, state it in that
   epic/feature bead's description and the planner carries it down into task
   criteria.
4. **The repo itself, including `CLAUDE.md`.** The planner's contract tells it to
   read key source files "to understand existing conventions and structure", and
   the reviewer explicitly checks for consistency "with existing patterns and
   conventions" -- your codebase's existing shape is an input. And because roles
   run as Claude Code sessions in your repo, a project `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code's
   native project-instructions file) is loaded for every session -- a Claude Code
   feature rather than a fleet-sprint one, but a real place to pin style rules and
   hard "never do X" constraints.
5. **The runbooks.** `deploy.md` and the playbooks encode operational decisions
   (how we deploy, what "healthy" means, what we verify) as enforced behavior,
   since agents execute them literally.

> **Rule of thumb:** durable cross-cutting conventions -> `bd remember` plus the
> `bd prime` session hook (and `CLAUDE.md` as belt-and-suspenders); sprint-scoped
> direction -> the requirements file; per-work-item constraints -> bead acceptance
> criteria.

## 6. What fleet-sprint actually does for you vs. what you still own

| fleet-sprint does this for you | You still own this |
| --- | --- |
| Decomposes your epics into a reviewed task graph with dependencies and per-task model tiers (cost routing) | Curating the epic and its children in beads with real acceptance criteria -- including pulling your AzDevOps or GitHub Issues backlog across (beads' own `bd ado sync` / `bd github sync` / `bd import` do the transport; the curation is yours) |
| Implements tasks: real commits on a branch, one per task, build/lint/unit checks run before each commit | Having a repo that builds; deciding product scope; recording architecture direction (`bd remember`, requirements file, bead descriptions, `CLAUDE.md`) |
| Independent AI code review against acceptance criteria, with reopen/redo loops applied deterministically by the engine | Final human review of the PR -- the PR is never auto-merged, and the verdict is advice, not authority |
| Deploys and smoke-tests -- by literally executing your runbook | Writing and maintaining `deploy.md`; keeping the CLI permission allowlist current (agents stop and report rather than self-granting) |
| Integration-verifies features with evidence, closes only what passes, files structured bugs for what fails | Writing `integ-test-playbook.md` (can start as manual verification steps) and deciding what "verified" means for your product |
| Once-per-sprint regression pass with sandbox lifecycle and carry-over bug filing | Writing `regression-test-playbook.md`; accepting that with zero existing tests, early sprints have thin regression coverage |
| Live dashboard: activity tree, cost in USD, health watchdog, stop control, raw logs | Watching it occasionally, and acting on a red badge or a FAIL verdict |
| Cost governance: per-task model tiers, optional USD budget ceiling, cost block written into the changelog | Setting the budget; paying the bill |
| Opens the PR with a plain PASS/FAIL verdict and a committed sprint analysis | Merging (or not), and everything that happens after merge -- your CI, your release process |
| Guards against operational foot-guns: member/scope reservation conflicts, deterministic-failure relaunch refusal, validated launches | Running the supervisor and fleet server; registering members; provisioning git and LLM credentials |

The pattern in that table is consistent: **fleet-sprint automates execution and
verification against artifacts you author.** Teams that invest a day or two in
sharp acceptance criteria, an honest `deploy.md`, and a first-cut playbook get an
autonomous loop that produces reviewable PRs with evidence attached. Teams that
skip the authoring get a system that -- to its credit -- stops and tells them
exactly which file or criterion is missing, rather than pretending. Start with one
epic, one member, one sprint, and a small budget ceiling, and judge it by the
first PR it opens.
