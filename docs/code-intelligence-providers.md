# Code Intelligence Providers

## Abstraction

Code intelligence (call graphs, impact analysis, structured/semantic search,
symbol context, architectural mapping, execution-flow tracing, and test
discovery) is exposed to the fleet through a single `CodeIntelligenceProvider`
interface (`src/tools/code-intelligence.ts`):

```ts
interface CodeIntelligenceProvider {
  graph(params): Promise<unknown>;
  impact(params): Promise<unknown>;
  query(params): Promise<unknown>;
  context(params): Promise<unknown>;
  map(params): Promise<unknown>;
  flow(params): Promise<unknown>;
  tests(params): Promise<unknown>;
}
```

The seven methods are the fixed contract every provider must implement, and
they correspond one-to-one with the fleet's `code_graph`, `code_impact`,
`code_query`, `code_context`, `code_map`, `code_flow`, and `code_tests` MCP
tools. A `PROVIDERS` registry maps provider names to instances; the active
provider is selected via a config file rather than being hardcoded, so a
second implementation can be added and switched to without touching the tool
handlers.

Rationale for the abstraction: the fleet's code intelligence today depends on
a single third-party tool (GitNexus). GitNexus is not Apache 2.0 / MIT / BSD
licensed, which is a constraint for downstream distribution. The provider
interface exists so an alternative, permissively-licensed backend can be
swapped in as the default without changing any call site -- every consumer
goes through `PROVIDERS[name]`, never through a concrete class directly.

## Evaluating a second provider: codebase-memory-mcp selected over Joern

Two Apache 2.0 / MIT candidates were evaluated as the permissively-licensed
replacement for GitNexus, across five dimensions: ease of integration,
dependency weight, language breadth, analysis depth, and MCP tool coverage
against the seven provider methods.

- **codebase-memory-mcp** (MIT) -- selected. It speaks the MCP protocol
  natively over stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0), the same transport the fleet already
  uses for GitNexus, so integration follows an identical client-lifecycle
  pattern with no custom subprocess scripting. It ships as a single static
  binary with no JVM or other runtime dependency, covers 158 languages via
  tree-sitter (versus Joern's roughly 10), and its 15 MCP tools map directly
  onto all seven provider methods (`search_graph` + `trace_path` for `graph`;
  `detect_changes` for `impact`; `query_graph`/`search_code` for `query`;
  `get_code_snippet` + `search_graph` for `context`; `get_architecture` for
  `map`; `trace_path` for `flow`; `search_graph` filtered to test paths for
  `tests`).

- **Joern** (Apache 2.0) -- rejected as the default, despite deeper
  control-flow and data-flow analysis (its Code Property Graph merges AST,
  CFG, PDG, and call graph, and supports taint tracking that
  codebase-memory-mcp does not attempt). Joern requires a JVM plus a Scala
  REPL and has no native MCP transport, meaning every call would need custom
  CLI-subprocess scripting; its narrower language coverage and heavier
  deployment footprint (JVM + Scala runtime versus a single ~40 MB binary)
  outweighed its analytical depth for this codebase's needs. Breadth,
  operational simplicity, and native MCP alignment were prioritized over
  maximum semantic depth.

The comparison is recorded here rather than in source: the rejected Joern
provider was never registered in `PROVIDERS`, so keeping a second, unused
implementation in the tree only invited the question of why it was there.

## Current status

`CodebaseMemoryProvider` (`src/tools/code-intelligence-codebase-memory.ts`)
is registered in the `PROVIDERS` map and is the default provider returned by
`getProvider()` when no config file selects another one. It follows the same
MCP client lifecycle as `GitNexusProvider`: a shared singleton client, a
`StdioClientTransport` over stdio, identity-guarded `onclose`/`onerror`
handlers that reset the cached client/connection-promise so the next call
reconnects from scratch, and a failure-reset path on a rejected connect.

Two guards run before the child process is ever touched:
- A pre-flight check verifies `~/.cache/codebase-memory-mcp/` exists and is
  non-empty (i.e. some project has been indexed); if not, the provider
  returns a structured "no index" result instructing the caller to index the
  project, instead of spawning the binary.
- Any connection failure or dead-client error is converted into a structured
  "offline" result (same MCP content-array shape, `isError: true`) rather
  than an unhandled throw, and the shared connection state is reset so the
  next call attempts a fresh connect.

`GitNexusProvider` remains registered and selectable via the `gitnexus` key
in the provider config, but is no longer the default. Joern was evaluated and
rejected (see above); no `JoernProvider` ships.

## Per-member provider selection

The `Agent` interface carries an optional `codeIntelProvider` field
(`'codebase-memory' | 'gitnexus' | 'none'`), and `register_member` /
`update_member` accept a matching `code_intel_provider` input so an
individual member's preferred provider can be set at registration time or
changed later. It is a per-member override of the fleet-wide default: a
member with `codeIntelProvider: 'none'` opts out of code intelligence
entirely, and a member with an explicit provider name routes to that
provider regardless of the global config.

Routing is wired end to end. `getProvider(memberId)`
(`src/tools/code-intelligence.ts`) resolves the calling member's
`codeIntelProvider` first and only falls back to the global config file when
the member has no override; an override naming a provider that is not
configured is a loud error, not a silent fallback. Every code-intel handler
(`handleCodeGraph`, `handleCodeImpact`, `handleCodeQuery`,
`handleCodeContext`, `handleCodeMap`, `handleCodeFlow`, `handleCodeTests`)
takes a `memberId` and passes it through, and `src/services/tool-registry.ts`
supplies it from `getActiveMemberId()`.

## KB initialization lifecycle: pre-init phase

Before a repo is indexed for code intelligence, a pre-init phase gathers
the information needed to show the user an informed opt-in prompt rather
than silently indexing (or silently failing) on first use. Two pure,
best-effort helpers back this phase:

- **Provider availability detection** -- checks whether the code-intel
  provider binary is installed and executable by invoking it with a
  version flag. It never throws: any spawn failure (binary missing,
  non-zero exit, timeout) degrades to a structured "not available" result
  carrying the underlying error message, rather than raising an exception
  that would need to be caught by every caller.

- **Index size estimation** -- walks a repo's file tree to project file
  count, total byte size, and an estimated indexing time, so the opt-in
  prompt can tell the user roughly what indexing will cost before they
  agree to it. The walk respects `.gitignore` patterns (a minimal glob
  matcher, not a full gitignore spec implementation, but covering the
  common anchored/unanchored/wildcard cases repos actually use) plus a
  fixed set of default excludes (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`,
  `out`, `coverage`, `.cache`, `vendor`) that are never meaningful to
  index regardless of gitignore content. Like provider detection, it never
  throws -- any walk failure degrades to a zeroed or partial estimate
  rather than propagating. Note the glob matcher does not implement
  negation patterns (`!pattern`); a gitignore that re-includes a path under
  an otherwise-excluded directory will still have that path excluded from
  the estimate. This is acceptable for a rough pre-init size estimate, but
  the init phase's actual file-selection logic (not yet built) should not
  assume this matcher's semantics are gitignore-complete.

This pre-init phase is scaffolding for the init phase (first-time repo
indexing with a progress-reporting opt-in prompt) and the update phase
(incremental re-indexing on code changes triggered by staleness
detection). Neither the init nor the update phase has been built yet, so
the pre-init helpers are not currently invoked from any call path -- they
exist ahead of their consumer, with unit test coverage locking in their
contract so the init-phase implementation can build on a stable interface.
