# GFX-2 dashboard GIF -- story script

Source file (no captions): `gfx2-dashboard-story.gif` (27 frames, 4.8MB, 1568x717).
Final file (captions burned in): `gfx2-dashboard-story-captioned.gif` (27 frames,
4.7MB, 1568x717), rendered with a throwaway Pillow script (no ffmpeg was
available on the capture machine).

The captioned version is the one to wire into the README. The beat sheet below
was used to time the captions frame-by-frame (verified against extracted PNGs,
not guessed) -- reuse this mapping if the GIF is ever re-cut or re-captioned.

Real capture, not staged: `apra-fleet workflow auto-sprint --issue apra-fleet-9te,apra-fleet-20i
--members fleet-rev --branch auto-sprint/gfx2-demo --base auto-sprint/eft-service
--viewer-port 18300 --max-cycles 2`, dashboard at `localhost:18300`. No frames were
recorded over a repeated-failure state; every beat below is a real, successful
transition pulled from the live run.

This is a beat sheet for overlaying captions/subtitles on the GIF (or cutting a
shorter version). Each beat names the dashboard state it corresponds to, so an
editor can time captions against the actual frame content rather than guessing.

## The arc

The two target beads were both mundane docs/logging tasks. What makes the
recording worth watching isn't the tasks -- it's that the sprint's own
integration-test gate caught two REAL bugs in the codebase mid-run, filed them
against itself as new beads, then planned, fixed, reviewed, and closed them in
a second cycle -- with no human in the loop. That is the literal "it builds
itself" claim from the README draft, caught on camera instead of asserted.

## Beats (in frame order)

1. **Cold open -- all collapsed.** Activity Tree fully collapsed to four
   top-level groups: Workflow / Sprint Setup / Sprint Cycle 1 / Sprint Cycle 2.
   Header stats: 251 Activities, 179,023 Tokens, 1hr 22m Uptime, LIVE.
   Caption idea: "One command. Then it runs on its own." /
   "1hr 22m of autonomous work, so far."

2. **Expand Sprint Cycle 1.** Reveals the phase skeleton: Plan C1 R1 -> Develop
   C1 R1 -> Review C1 R1 -> ... -> Deploy C1 -> Integ Test C1.
   Caption idea: "Plan. Develop. Review. Deploy. Test. Repeat."

3. **Expand Plan C1 R1.** Shows the raw dispatch commands (git/bd sync) leading
   into the Planner agent call.
   Caption idea: "Every step is logged -- nothing runs silently."

4. **Scroll to the end of Sprint Cycle 1 -- Integ Test C1.** The load-bearing
   shot: `Integration tests FAILED this cycle (C1, bugsFiled: apra-fleet-9te.2,
   apra-fleet-9te.3)`. Expanded, the full line reads: real integ suite run
   against a deploy-verified SHA, one part blocked by a stale status file, one
   part failing on a real `workflow auto-sprint not found` install bug --
   both filed as new beads on the spot.
   Caption idea: "The integration tester found two real bugs -- and filed them
   against itself." This is the single most important beat; give it the most
   caption dwell time / hold-frame if cutting for length.

5. **Collapse back to top level, expand Sprint Cycle 2.** Reveals a second
   full Plan -> Develop -> Review loop that did not exist when the sprint
   started -- it exists because of beat 4.
   Caption idea: "It didn't stop. It re-planned around what it found."

6. **Expand Develop C2 R1.** Shows `AGENT: Streak [apra-fleet-9te.2.1]`
   completing SUCCESS (176.2s, 15,064 tokens), then the doer's own report:
   "Fixed scripts/run-integ-suites.mjs ...".
   Caption idea: "Same fleet, same run -- now fixing its own bug."

7. **Switch to the Tasks tab, scroll to the Sprint group.** Shows
   `#apra-fleet-9te.3` (the install-path bug) and `#apra-fleet-9te.2` (the
   stale-status-file bug) with their `[impl]` children CLOSED.
   Caption idea: "Filed, fixed, closed -- in the same sprint." This is the
   closing shot; hold it a beat longer than the others as the outro frame.

## Final burned-in captions (verified frame ranges)

| Frames | Caption |
|---|---|
| 0-2 | IT'S BEEN WORKING FOR 1HR 22M. NO ONE TOLD IT TO. |
| 3-4 | PLAN -> BUILD -> REVIEW -> SHIP -> TEST. ON REPEAT. |
| 5-8 | EVERY MOVE, ON THE RECORD. |
| 9-14 | THEN ITS OWN TESTS CAUGHT 2 REAL BUGS -- AND FILED THEM AGAINST ITSELF. |
| 15-18 | MOST TOOLS WOULD STOP HERE. |
| 19-20 | THIS ONE JUST... RE-PLANNED. |
| 21-23 | SAME FLEET. SAME RUN. FIXING ITS OWN MISTAKE. |
| 24-25 | PATCHED. REVIEWED. VERIFIED. |
| 26 | FOUND IT. FIXED IT. CLOSED IT. NOBODY WATCHED. |

## Suggested trim for a 20-30s loop

If the full 27-frame GIF runs long for the README's <8MB / 20-30s spec, the
beats to keep (in order) are: 1 (cold open), 4 (bugs filed -- the payoff),
6 (doer fixing it), 7 (closed, outro). Beats 2/3/5 are connective tissue and
the first to cut if trimming.

## Known rough edges (say these out loud if asked, don't hide them)

- The first Planner dispatch of the run failed with `empty_response` (stale
  OAuth session on `fleet-rev`); a `provision_llm_auth` re-auth fixed it and
  the retry succeeded on attempt 2/5. Not shown in this GIF, but worth knowing
  if a longer cut or a transcript excerpt is published alongside it -- it is
  itself an honest data point about real (not scripted) autonomous operation.
- `apra-fleet-9te.3.2` and `apra-fleet-9te.2.2` (the test tasks for the two
  self-filed bugs) were still OPEN as of this capture -- the fix commits
  landed and were reviewer-approved, but the sprint had not yet closed the
  test-task siblings when this GIF was captured. Don't caption this as "fully
  closed end to end" without re-checking final state.
