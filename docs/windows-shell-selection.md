# Windows shell selection: probing the real shell instead of assuming PowerShell

## Why the OS field is not enough

A registered member's OS being `windows` is not evidence that its
interactive/login shell is PowerShell -- a large share of real-world Windows
dev machines run Git-for-Windows Bash as the default shell. Assuming
PowerShell for every Windows member is also expensive in its own right:
PowerShell's semantics (false-success on non-terminating errors, `$OFS`
array-splitting, CLIXML-wrapped stderr, alias collisions such as `curl`) are
a disproportionate source of live-discovered bugs.

## The `shell` field: finer-grained than `os`

The member schema carries an optional `shell` field --
`'gitbash' | 'pwsh7' | 'powershell5'` -- alongside the existing `os` field.
`os` answers "what platform is this," `shell` answers "what interpreter
actually executes the command strings we send it." Code that branches
command construction for a Windows member must branch on `shell` (via the
`isPosixShell(os, shell)` predicate in `src/utils/agent-helpers.ts`), not on
`os === 'windows'` alone -- `os === 'windows'` with `shell === 'gitbash'` is a
POSIX command-construction target, byte-identical in shape to a Linux/macOS
member. This is the key delta from the general cross-shell guidance in
[docs/cross-shell-command-construction.md](cross-shell-command-construction.md),
which frames every branch point as an `agent.os` check -- that guidance is
correct as a POSIX-vs-PowerShell framing, but any Windows-specific call site
should resolve through the registered `shell`, not `os`, wherever the
member's actual shell has been probed and recorded.

## Probe order and trust rule

At registration and on update, a Windows member is probed in this order and
the FIRST candidate that actually proves itself working is registered:

1. **Git-for-Windows Bash** (`gitbash`)
2. **PowerShell 7** (`pwsh7`)
3. **PowerShell 5.1** (`powershell5`) -- final fallback

A candidate is only trusted when a real smoke command against it returns
BOTH exit code 0 AND an expected marker in stdout. Presence or path
existence alone is never sufficient -- a `bash.exe` file existing at a path,
or a `pwsh` binary being resolvable, proves nothing about whether it
actually runs. If every probe fails outright, registration still succeeds
and degrades to `powershell5` with a surfaced warning, rather than failing
the whole registration -- an unprobeable environment should not block a
member from joining the fleet, but the degraded state must be visible to
whoever registered it, not silently assumed.

### WSL/System32 bash.exe disambiguation

`bash.exe` is not a unique identifier for Git-for-Windows Bash: WSL ships
its own launcher at `%SystemRoot%\System32\bash.exe` (and a
WindowsApps-shimmed variant) with the same binary name but entirely
different semantics. A candidate resolved from PATH is rejected by BOTH its
path (known WSL/System32/WindowsApps launcher locations are excluded
up front) AND its runtime behavior (`uname` output must indicate a real
MINGW/MSYS environment, not the Linux subsystem) before it is trusted as
`gitbash`. Checking only one of the two would let a WSL launcher masquerade
as Git-for-Windows Bash, reintroducing the exact ambiguity the probe exists
to eliminate.

## Invariant: probe and command-builder must share one git-bash candidate list

The shell probe's Git-Bash discovery step checks the two Program Files
roots, `Program Files\Git\usr\bin`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Git\bin\bash.exe`
(the default location for a user-scope, non-admin Git for Windows install),
and any additional binary PATH resolves to via `Get-Command bash.exe -All`.
The Windows-Git-Bash command builder that constructs actual command strings
for an already-registered `gitbash` member must probe the identical
candidate set when it re-resolves the bash executable path at command-build
time -- not a narrower subset. If the two lists diverge, a member whose only
working Git-for-Windows Bash install lives at a candidate the probe checks
but the builder doesn't (the user-scope `%LOCALAPPDATA%` install is the
concrete case) probes and registers successfully as `gitbash`, but then has
every actual command sent to it built against a bare, PATH-resolved
`bash.exe` fallback -- silently reintroducing the WSL/System32 ambiguity the
probe was built to close, for exactly the member the probe is supposed to
protect. Both the probe's remote discovery script and the local resolver
consume one shared candidate-list literal (`src/os/git-bash-candidates.ts`,
including the shared user-scope suffix), with the parity between the two
test-asserted rather than left to be kept in sync by convention -- a
structurally enforced invariant, not just a documented expectation.

Consistent with the "no silent degradation" theme above: the local
resolver does not fall back to a bare, PATH-resolved `bash.exe` when none
of the known-good candidates check out -- it throws, surfacing the failure
to its caller instead of quietly reintroducing the WSL/System32 ambiguity
this section describes.

## Design decision: core and fleet-sprint implement this pattern independently

Both apra-fleet core (compiled TypeScript binary) and fleet-sprint plus its
supervisor (open, user-copyable `.mjs` source) need the same underlying
capability: build member-bound command strings appropriate to the member's
actual registered shell instead of a fixed PowerShell assumption. These are
implemented as two separate, structurally-parallel implementations rather
than one shared package, for two reasons:

1. **Different distribution models.** Core ships as a compiled TypeScript
   binary; fleet-sprint and supervisor ship as plain `.mjs` source a user
   copies directly. A shared workspace package would force build/versioning
   coupling across two distribution models that otherwise have none.
2. **fleet-sprint is meant to stay apra-fleet-agnostic**, an existing repo
   convention independent of this feature. A shared package risks smuggling
   apra-fleet-specific concepts into code that is supposed to work
   standalone.

Each side extends a POSIX base class and overrides only the Windows-native
surface that actually differs (credential path root, PID capture, and
similar primitives) -- the same "extends the POSIX implementation, override
only what's Windows-specific" shape on both sides, even though the two
implementations share no code. If fleet-sprint/supervisor are ever packaged
as listeners served directly by the core binary, unifying the two at that
point is a mechanical merge of two structurally-identical implementations,
not a redesign.

Both sides are wired into their real command-construction call sites. On the
core side, the command-construction call sites listed above route through the
registered shell. On the fleet-sprint side, dolt-settle's
install/kill/spawn/teardown and node-eval command strings, and the runner's
`buildSettleCallback` call sites, resolve and thread the member's registered
shell through `se-os-commands` rather than building a fixed PowerShell
string.

One import-path subtlety worth keeping in mind when extending this: any
script body executed via WMI/`Win32_Process` (used to install, probe, and
kill the pinned dolt server process) is *always* interpreted by PowerShell
on the invoking host, regardless of which shell the target member is
registered with. A helper that resolves "the member's shell-dialect path"
for embedding into such a script body is a latent bug for a `gitbash`
member -- a POSIX-dialect path (e.g. a `$HOME`-relative one) embedded
directly into a PowerShell script string breaks silently. The fix pattern
is to resolve two forms up front -- one in the member's own shell dialect
for member-shell-executed commands, one always in PowerShell dialect for
anything embedded in a WMI/PowerShell script body -- and pass the correct
one to each consumer explicitly. "Shell-aware" means "one value per dialect
of the string you are embedding it into," not "one value per member."

## `isPosixShell`: one exported helper, not several private copies

The `isPosixShell(os, shell)` predicate that decides whether a member's
outbound commands should be built as POSIX or PowerShell is a single
exported, overloaded helper in `src/utils/agent-helpers.ts` (accepting either
a raw OS value or a convenience `isWindows` boolean, plus the optional
registered shell), with one call-site-facing wrapper
(`isPosixShellMember(agent)`) that reads both fields off an `Agent` and
delegates to it. Every call site imports the shared helper rather than
carrying a private copy. The semantics are
`!isWindows || shell === 'gitbash'`. New call sites should import the
shared helper rather than reintroducing a private copy -- multiple
independently-maintained copies of the same predicate is exactly the kind
of thing that silently diverges over time even when each copy starts out
correct.
