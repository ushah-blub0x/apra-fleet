# npm Packaging -- As-Built Reference

Authoritative description of how apra-fleet is packaged and published.

---

## 1. Two Delivery Modes

apra-fleet ships in two mutually exclusive runtime forms that can coexist on
the same machine:

| Mode | How installed | Entry point | process.execPath |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `sea` | GitHub release binary | platform ELF/PE/Mach-O | the binary itself |
| `npm` | `npm i -g @apralabs/apra-fleet` | `dist/index.js` run by node | the node executable |
| `dev` | `node dist/index.js` from source tree | `dist/index.js` | the node executable |

Coexistence is safe because:
- The SEA binary installs to `~/.local/share/apra-fleet/apra-fleet` (or equivalent).
- The npm global install goes to the npm prefix (`node_modules/@apralabs/apra-fleet/`).
- Neither overwrites the other; the two `binaryPath` values are distinct.

No code path copies a binary or registers an MCP entry point without first
detecting the mode (see Section 2).

---

## 2. Delivery-Mode Detection

### 2.1 isSea() -- src/cli/install.ts

```
export function isSea(): boolean
```

Calls `require('node:sea').isSea()` at runtime. Returns `false` in any error
catch (dev or npm mode, where `node:sea` is not available). A test-only override
`_setSeaOverride(v: boolean | null)` exists; set to `null` to restore default.
`isSea` is now `export`-ed so `update.ts` and `delivery-mode.ts` can import it
directly.

### 2.2 isNpmGlobalInstall() -- src/cli/install.ts

```
export function isNpmGlobalInstall(): boolean
```

Returns `true` when ALL of the following hold:
1. `isSea()` is `false`.
2. `process.argv[1]` contains the string `node_modules`.
3. The project root resolved by `findProjectRoot()` does NOT contain a `.git`
   directory (i.e., `fs.existsSync(path.join(projectRoot, '.git'))` is `false`).

**Why the .git check, not a path comparison?**

An earlier approach compared `process.argv[1]` against
`findProjectRoot() + '/dist/index.js'`. This failed silently because
`findProjectRoot()` anchors on the module's own `__dirname`, which for a real
npm global install resolves to the npm package's `dist/` directory.
`process.argv[1]` is also `<npm-package-root>/dist/index.js`. The comparison
was therefore a path against itself and could never return `true`, so npm mode
was never detected and the dev-mode message was printed instead.

The `.git` directory check is the correct signal: a real npm global install of
a published tarball has no `.git/` at its package root; a dev checkout always
does. This is reliable across platforms and does not depend on path string
matching.

If `findProjectRoot()` throws, `isNpmGlobalInstall()` returns `true` (the catch
branch): if we cannot locate a project root at all, we are not in a dev checkout.

### 2.3 getDeliveryMode() / getDeliveryInfo() -- src/delivery-mode.ts

```
export type DeliveryMode = 'sea' | 'npm' | 'dev';

export function getDeliveryMode(): DeliveryMode
  // isSea() -> 'sea'; isNpmGlobalInstall() -> 'npm'; else -> 'dev'

export function getDeliveryInfo(): { mode: DeliveryMode; binary: string; nodeVersion: string }
  // binary: process.execPath for sea; process.argv[1] for npm + dev
  // nodeVersion: process.version
```

`getDeliveryInfo()` is the canonical diagnostic call. It is consumed by the
`--version` handler (Section 5) and is available as a foundation for any future
`status` command or `/health` endpoint (see Section 6).

---

## 3. Version Resolution -- src/version.ts

### 3.1 Priority chain

`resolveVersion()` (called once at module scope, result exported as `serverVersion`) follows:

1. **BUILD_VERSION** -- esbuild `define` constant injected at SEA bundle time.
   If defined and non-undefined, return immediately (no file I/O). This is the
   SEA path.

2. **ESM path** -- `typeof __dirname === 'undefined'` is true for tsc ESM output
   (npm mode). Computes `dir` via `dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))`,
   then `root = join(dir, '..')`. Delegates to `resolveVersionFromRoot(root)`.

3. **CJS path** -- `__dirname` is defined (SEA bundle is CJS; this branch also
   handles dev mode with CJS tooling). `root = join(__dirname, '..')`. Delegates
   to `resolveVersionFromRoot(root)`.

4. **v0.0.0-unknown** -- catch block inside `resolveVersionFromRoot` if
   `version.json` is missing or unreadable.

### 3.2 resolveVersionFromRoot(rootDir)

Exported as a testability seam. Reads `version.json` from `rootDir`, returns
`v<semver>`. Appends a `_<6-hex>` git-hash suffix if `.git/HEAD` exists (dev
mode only; npm tarballs contain no `.git/`). Callers can pass a nonexistent
`rootDir` to exercise the fallback path without mocking native built-ins.

### 3.3 Why createRequire(import.meta.url)?

All `fs`/`path`/`url` imports inside `version.ts` are loaded lazily via
`createRequire(import.meta.url)` rather than top-level ESM `import` statements.
This is intentional: `serverVersion` is assigned at module scope (eagerly, when
the module loads). `tests/update.test.ts` mocks `node:fs` at module scope via
`vi.mock('node:fs')`. A static top-level `import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'`
would be intercepted by that mock, resolving `serverVersion` to `v0.0.0-unknown`
at load time and breaking three update tests. Lazy `createRequire` bypasses
the vitest `vi.mock` interceptor for `node:module` (which is not mocked), so
`serverVersion` resolves correctly in both the runtime and test contexts.

---

## 4. apra-fleet update -- per-mode behavior

Implemented in `src/cli/update.ts`. The mode check runs before any network
call.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `npm` | Prints `npm update -g @apralabs/apra-fleet`, then blank line, then `apra-fleet install` skill-refresh reminder. Returns. No fetch. |
| `dev` | Prints `apra-fleet is running in dev mode. Pull the latest source and rebuild.` Returns. No fetch. |
| `sea` | Proceeds to GitHub Releases API fetch + binary download (existing logic, unchanged). |

The skill-refresh reminder (`apra-fleet install`) is required because
`npm update -g` replaces the `dist/` files but does NOT re-copy skills or hooks
that were previously installed to `~/.claude/skills/` or hook directories.
Running `apra-fleet install` after updating is the correct refresh procedure.

---

## 5. apra-fleet --version output

Implemented in `src/index.ts`. Output is three lines:

```
apra-fleet v0.2.2_d86bc6
  Mode:   npm (node v22.x.x)
  Binary: /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@apralabs/apra-fleet/dist/index.js
```

SEA mode omits the `(node ...)` suffix:

```
apra-fleet v0.2.2
  Mode:   sea
  Binary: /home/user/.local/share/apra-fleet/apra-fleet
```

Dev mode (no `.git` hash suffix in npm tarball; hash present in dev checkout):

```
apra-fleet v0.2.2_a2b4fd
  Mode:   dev (node v20.19.0)
  Binary: C:\akhil\git\apra-fleet\dist\index.js
```

**This output is the diagnostic substitute for a `status` command, which does
not exist in the codebase.** When diagnosing coexistence issues (wrong binary
in PATH, unexpected mode), `apra-fleet --version` is the correct first step.

---

## 6. Not Implemented

The following do not exist in the codebase, and packaging does not depend on
them:

- `src/services/service-manager/` with `windows.ts`, `linux.ts`, `macos.ts`
- A `status` CLI command
- A `/health` endpoint

Coexistence diagnostics are limited to what `getDeliveryMode()` /
`getDeliveryInfo()` in `src/delivery-mode.ts` expose via `--version`. A future
`status` command would import `getDeliveryInfo()` from `./delivery-mode.js` as
its foundation. Service overwrite warnings and cross-mode `/health` are deferred
until service-manager infrastructure exists.

There is also no `start`, `stop`, `restart` CLI subcommand in the current
codebase. The `--help` text does not list them.

---

## 7. npm Package Contents

### 7.1 files whitelist (package.json)

```json
"files": [
  "dist/",
  "hooks/",
  "scripts/fleet-statusline.sh",
  "scripts/agy-settings-merge.js",
  "scripts/agy-transcript-reader.js",
  "skills/",
  "version.json"
]
```

**What is shipped:** compiled JS (`dist/`), hooks config, three runtime scripts,
skills (fleet + pm), and `version.json`.

**Workspace packages are intentionally private** (apra-fleet-3ns.4):
`packages/apra-fleet-se`, `packages/apra-fleet-workflow`, and
`packages/apra-fleet-client` all set `"private": true` in their own
`package.json` -- `npm publish` from any of those directories refuses. They
are consumed exclusively via the root `@apralabs/apra-fleet` package's
bundled `dist/` output described below, never published or installed as
standalone npm packages. (`packages/fleet-api-contract` is the one exception
-- it IS a real, independently published package with its own `files`/
`publishConfig`, unrelated to this bundling story.)

Inside `dist/`, one build step contributes content beyond tsc's own
TypeScript output:

- `scripts/dist-pm.mjs` (prepublishOnly) copies `packages/apra-fleet-se/apra-pm`'s
  `skills/pm`, `agents/` (including `agents/schemas/*.json`),
  and `.claude/workflows/` into `dist/skills/pm`, `dist/agents/`, and
  `dist/workflows/` respectively -- needed because most of `packages/` is not
  shipped in `dist/`-copied form; this content ships only if copied into
  `dist/`.

**The fleet-sprint engine ships as source, not a bundle.** There is no
`scripts/bundle-se.mjs` or `build:se` script -- no esbuild step produces
`dist/fleet-sprint.mjs` or `dist/fleet-sprint-runner.mjs`, and the root
`bin` field no longer has a `fleet-sprint` entry (see 7.2 below). Instead,
`package.json`'s `files` allowlist ships the engine's source directories
directly, unbundled:

- `packages/apra-fleet-se/workflow.json` -- names `packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/cli.mjs`
  as the engine's entry point.
- `packages/apra-fleet-se/fleet-sprint/` -- the engine itself (`runner.js`,
  loaded at runtime via `engine.executeFile()`, not imported/bundled, plus its
  `contracts.mjs`/`errors.mjs`/`viewer-extensions.mjs`/`conflict-ladder.mjs`/
  `sprint-lock.mjs` siblings).
- `packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/` -- the provider-agnostic `fleet-sprint` CLI
  entry (`cli.mjs`), which has a top-level static import of `../fleet-sprint/runner.js`.
- `packages/apra-fleet-se/apra-pm/agents/` and `packages/apra-fleet-se/apra-pm/skills/`
  -- the apra-pm agent/skill definitions the engine dispatches against.
- `packages/apra-fleet-workflow/src/` and `packages/apra-fleet-client/src/`
  (plus each package's own `package.json`) -- the workspace dependencies
  `runner.js`/`cli.mjs` import as `@apralabs/apra-fleet-workflow` and
  `@apralabs/apra-fleet-client`.

npm users reach the engine via the unified `apra-fleet workflow fleet-sprint`
command (`src/cli/workflow.ts`), not a separate bare `fleet-sprint` bin. That
launcher's `buildDevManifest()`/`collectPackageTree()` resolve
`packages/apra-fleet-se` inside the installed
`node_modules/@apralabs/apra-fleet/` tree the same way they resolve it inside
a git-checkout dev tree -- the shipped subset mirrors the dev-checkout layout
1:1, so no separate path-resolution logic is needed for the npm-installed
case. Schema resolution still finds the `dist/agents/schemas/` directory
`dist-pm.mjs` populated (apra-fleet-bun / apra-fleet-3ns.2.1). See
`packages/apra-fleet-se/docs/cli-reference.md` for the full schema- and
server-resolution order.

**The always-on supervisor process has the same self-containment obligation as
the rest of the shipped engine, and it is easy to violate one file at a time:**
any module the supervisor can reach must resolve entirely inside the shipped
`packages/apra-fleet-se` tree, never via a repo-root-relative import into a
top-level directory this packaging step excludes (`test`, `docs`, `scripts`,
`examples`). See "Supervisor: packaging self-containment" in
`packages/apra-fleet-se/docs/architecture.md` for the vendoring pattern used
to fix a real instance of this and the graph-shaped regression guard that
checks the whole reachable import graph, not just a single previously-broken
file.

**`@apralabs/apra-fleet-client` must be a real root `dependencies` entry, not
just a shipped `files` path.** Shipping a package's source under the `files`
allowlist makes it present on disk in an npm install, but that alone does not
make it resolvable via standard Node module resolution -- a bare specifier
import (`import('@apralabs/apra-fleet-client/...')`) only resolves if the
package is registered as a dependency (here, a `file:` dependency pointing at
the shipped subdirectory) so that npm's installer creates the corresponding
`node_modules/@apralabs/apra-fleet-client` entry. In a git-checkout dev tree
this distinction is invisible because npm workspaces symlinks every
workspace package into `node_modules/@apralabs/...` regardless of whether the
root `dependencies` block lists it -- so a missing `dependencies` entry only
surfaces as a failure for a real npm-installed (non-workspace) consumer,
never in dev-mode testing. Any workspace package that ships as source via
`files` and is imported at runtime by shipped code needs both: the `files`
entry (so the bytes are present) and a root `dependencies` entry (so Node's
resolver can find them).

Note: the SEA/installed-binary delivery mode (`apra-fleet workflow <name>`,
see `docs/authoring-workflows.md`) adds a further tier to both resolution
orders ahead of the ones described above -- `APRA_FLEET_SE_SCHEMAS_DIR`
(set by the workflow launcher to `~/.apra-fleet/schemas`) is schema
resolution's tier 1, and the launcher's HTTP-singleton-probe-first /
stdio-self-spawn-fallback order (`docs/adr-workflow-server-resolution.md`)
applies before `resolveFleetServerCommand()`'s four stdio tiers. This does
not change the npm/`dist/` + source-`packages/` bundling described in this
section; it only applies when running via the installed SEA binary.

**What is NOT shipped:** `src/` (TypeScript source), `tsconfig.json`, build
scripts (`scripts/build-sea.mjs`, `scripts/gen-sea-config.mjs`,
`scripts/package-sea.mjs`, `scripts/install-hooks.mjs`, `scripts/dist-pm.mjs`),
`node_modules/`, SEA artifacts (`dist/sea-bundle.cjs`, `dist/sea-prep.blob`,
`dist/*.exe`, platform binaries), and `packages/apra-fleet-se/test/` /
`packages/apra-fleet-se/sprint-logs/` (explicitly excluded from the `files`
allowlist below even though sibling source directories under
`packages/apra-fleet-se/` are shipped). `packages/apra-fleet-se`,
`-workflow`, and `-client` remain `"private": true` (apra-fleet-3ns.4) and
cannot be `npm publish`ed standalone -- their source ships only as a
dependency subtree of the root `@apralabs/apra-fleet` package via the
explicit `files` allowlist, never as an independent package.

The `scripts/` entries are explicit individual files, not a `scripts/` glob.
This is intentional: a bare `scripts/` glob would ship the `.mjs` build scripts.
Likewise, the `packages/apra-fleet-se/*` entries are specific subdirectory
globs, not a blanket `packages/apra-fleet-se/` entry -- that would additionally
pull in `test/` (11 MB) and `sprint-logs/` (2.4 MB).
**Maintenance note:** if a new runtime script is added under `scripts/`, or a
new source directory is added under any shipped `packages/*` subtree, it must
also be added to `files` manually or it will be silently excluded from the
tarball.

Validated tarball size (post apra-fleet-fyc.2, measured via `npm pack --dry-run`
on this checkout): 1.1 MB packed / 4.4 MB unpacked, 891 files.

### 7.2 Other package.json fields

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `name` | `@apralabs/apra-fleet` | Scoped; requires `@apralabs` npm org |
| `version` | matches `version.json` | Must match at publish time (CI's version lockstep guard) |
| `bin` | `{ "apra-fleet": "dist/index.js" }` | npm sets the executable bit; the fleet-sprint engine is reached via `apra-fleet workflow fleet-sprint`, not a separate bin entry |
| `engines.node` | `>=22.0.0` | Node 22 required for `node:sea` API + native `fetch` |
| `publishConfig.access` | `public` | Required for scoped packages on public npm |
| `prepublishOnly` | `npm run dist-pm && npm run build` | Copies the apra-pm package content into `dist/`, then runs tsc -- no bundling step remains |
| `type` | `module` | ESM output; tsc emits `.js` (not `.mjs`) |

## 8. Release / CI -- npm-publish job

### 8.1 Job location

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, job name `npm-publish`, after the `release` job.

### 8.2 Trigger guard

```yaml
if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')
```

The job runs ONLY when a `v*` tag is pushed.

### 8.3 Job structure

- `needs: build-and-test` (NOT `package`, `build-binary`, or `sign-windows`)
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- `permissions: contents: read, id-token: write` (job-level only)
- `environment: npm`

Steps in order:
1. Checkout + Setup Node 22.x with `registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org`
2. `npm ci`
3. **Inject version from tag** -- rewrites `package.json` and `version.json`
   with the semver extracted from `GITHUB_REF` (strips `refs/tags/v` prefix)
4. **Version lockstep guard** -- asserts tag == `package.json.version` ==
   `version.json.version`; fails the job if they diverge
5. `npm run prepublishOnly` (labeled "Build") -- runs the full
   prepublishOnly sequence explicitly, since npm only fires
   `prepublishOnly` automatically on `npm publish`, not on the `npm pack
   --dry-run` calls this job makes later. Produces `dist/index.js` and
   `dist/agents/schemas/`; the fleet-sprint engine itself ships as source
   under `packages/apra-fleet-se/` via the `files` allowlist, not as a
   `dist/`-built artifact (apra-fleet-fyc.2, post apra-fleet-kuh.5).
6. **Verify shebang** -- checks `dist/index.js` and
   `packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/cli.mjs` both start with
   `#!/usr/bin/env node`
7. **Dry-run pack verification** -- `npm pack --dry-run`; greps for required
   files (`dist/index.js`, `version.json`, `hooks/hooks-config.json`, `skills/`,
   `packages/apra-fleet-se/bin/cli.mjs`, `packages/apra-fleet-se/fleet-sprint/runner.js`,
   `packages/apra-fleet-se/workflow.json`, `dist/agents/schemas/`)
8. **Clean-pack guard** -- rejects `*.exe`, `sea-prep.blob`, `sea-bundle.cjs`
   in the pack output; fails if unpacked size exceeds 10 MB. The size check
   is implemented by `scripts/check-pack-size.mjs`, which parses `npm pack
   --dry-run --json` for the real byte count rather than scraping npm's
   human-readable notice line (`npm notice unpacked size: 4.1 MB`) with a
   regex -- a plain `grep -oE '[0-9]+'` against that human-readable string
   only ever captures the leading digits before the decimal point (e.g. `4`
   out of `4.1 MB`), which is off by six orders of magnitude and made the
   10 MB threshold comparison permanently unable to fire regardless of
   actual tarball size. Any guard that needs to compare against a real size
   or count must be pointed at a tool's structured/JSON output, never at a
   human-readable notice line meant for terminal display.
9. **Pack + install into a clean temp prefix (fleet-sprint smoke test)**
   (apra-fleet-3ns.2 / apra-fleet-3ns.2.2, updated by apra-fleet-fyc.2.1) --
   packs a real tarball, `npm install`s it into a fresh non-workspace prefix
   (no monorepo ancestor, no pre-existing `node_modules`), runs `apra-fleet
   install` (extracts `~/.apra-fleet/{node_modules,schemas,workflows/fleet-sprint}`
   from the installed package's own `packages/apra-fleet-se` and
   `packages/apra-fleet-workflow`/`apra-fleet-client` trees), then runs
   `apra-fleet workflow fleet-sprint --help`, and asserts (a) the expected
   usage text prints and (b) stderr does NOT contain the apra-fleet-bun.1
   dev-fallback warning -- proving the packed, installed engine resolves its
   schemas from the co-packaged `dist/agents/schemas/`, not a monorepo path
   that would not exist in a real install. A separate runner-import smoke
   script (formerly `scripts/smoke-test-runner-import.mjs`) is no longer
   needed: `cli.mjs` has a top-level static import of `../fleet-sprint/runner.js`,
   so the `--help` path already resolves the full runtime import graph.
10. **Idempotency check** -- `npm view @apralabs/apra-fleet@<tag> version`;
    skips publish if already published (reruns the job safely)
11. **Publish** -- `npm publish --provenance --access public`; skipped if step 10
    set `already_published=true`; uses `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}`

### 8.4 Hard constraint

**An actual publish requires a human to:**
1. Create and push a `v*` tag (e.g., `git tag v0.2.2 && git push origin v0.2.2`)
2. Ensure the `NPM_TOKEN` secret is present in the repository
3. Ensure the `@apralabs` npm org exists and the token has publish rights

The CI job enforces version lockstep and pack hygiene automatically, but it
cannot run without a tag + secret. This is intentional.

The `release` job (SEA binaries) is unchanged; its `needs` list does not include
`npm-publish` and `npm-publish` does not block it.
